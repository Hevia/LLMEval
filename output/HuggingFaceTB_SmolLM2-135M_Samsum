Clara: Hi, what you up to?
Neela: Not much, chilling out.
Clara: Just rewatching Dear White People on Netflix, love it!😍
Neela: Oh yeah, heard of it, but not seen it yet? Any good?
Clara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.
Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.
Neela: Yeah, but why is it so good?
Clara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.
Neela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?
Clara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.
Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested?
Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.
Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!
Sophie: Thank you for the quince!
Noah: I'm so glad you're so happy!
Noah: I",Sophie accepts some quince from Noah. Noah has left the quince in a basket on his terrace and the twins can pick it up any time. The twins are in college. Noah's son is in the military.

Zach: You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future.

Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.

Bobby: I was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on.
Mickey: And what of it?
Bobby: Imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses!
Mickey: What? Are u sure?
Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
Mickey: So what? There are many illnesses and diseases I've never heard of. 
Bobby: So I did some research. Turns out such a thing does not exist. No medical journal writes about it, no medical forum suggests caution.
Mickey: That doesn't mean it doesn't exist. 
Bobby: I even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness.

Bobby: So I put my mind to it and do u know what I came up with?
Mickey: What?

Bobby: Can't be sure, but probably 4ever. Imagine every illness, disease and so on. Where do these come from? Why do they spread so fast?
Mickey: That is kinda puzzling.
Bobby: Right?
Mickey: So why is no one doing anything about it?

Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much

Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
