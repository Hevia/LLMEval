- Brennan: Over what ?
- Jayden: The end of normal life. Being pregnant, suffering because of this etc

- Jayden: Being obligated to be with the. 24h. Men have only sex and they wait for kids while women suffer
- Brennan: I don't agree...
- Jayden: I wish I could do the same. Then probably i would say the same like u.
- Brennan: Guys like me would be there through it all to reduce the suffering
- Jayden: Physical suffering. No one can do anything with this. I wish I could just have sex and wait for a baby while having a normal life. Not getting fat, having the same body, the same breast and not disgusting ... Not feeling sick, not having pain, being able to do every day stuff even like walking...

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.

Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better

Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat
Charles: Thanks! I'm really worried, because it's getting worse and I have no idea what's happening with me","+ 
+ Karen: I'm sorry, but I don't think you should stop eating gluten.
- Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?
- Karen: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I've heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I don't think may lead to your death
- Jack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?
- Charles: Hm, I don't know, I feel that I may be allergic or something
- Monica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:
- Monica: <file_other>, <file_other>
- Karen: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me
- Karen: When it comes to intolerance... I know it's very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I don't believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you're fine
- Jack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she's absolutely fine
- Charles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I don't eat much
- Karen: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better
- Monica: I did the same thing with lactose, I wasn't feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I'm much better now
- Jack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?
- Monica: It just happened, I was all right until I wasn't. I don't know how it works, but it happens
- Charles: I think it's the same with me. I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare
- Karen: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?
- Charles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet
- Karen: It may be, but I'm not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier can't do you any harm
- Monica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you shouldn't eat
