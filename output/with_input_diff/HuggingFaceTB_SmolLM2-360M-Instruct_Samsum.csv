- Hayden: Anyway I have 1 month to write my thesis. And then I need to decide what studies I should choose and I have a problem because I don't know what I can do in the future to make good money
- Margaret: You'll find something
- Hayden: And the only studies I'm interested in are African studies but I'm not sure I can make big money later on haha except for working in the embassy or something like that. I was thinking about working as a flight attendant. It would be easy for me to get that job since I can swim (and here it's obligatory) I'm even a water rescuer. I know English italian and polish and a bit of german.
- Margaret: So go ahead for it
- Hayden: But to be honest , I don't think so that job is so great. I can't work there forever and I'm not that sure I wanna risk every time hahah since flight accidents happen
- Margaret: Hahahaha you shouldn't think about that

- Ronnie: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that.
- Clint: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow
- Ronnie: That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong!

- Tim: It's a girl's name here. Doesn't sound very brother-like.
- Samuel: My apologies. 
- Tim: So what is your language?
- Samuel: It is Telugu, brother. 
- Tim: is that spoken in India?
- Samuel: Yes, in South east India. Bangalore and Chennai and other places. Nearly 90 million speakers, brother.
- Tim: Is it one of those written right to left?
- Samuel: No, it is written left to right. It is based on Brahmin script, our writing. If you trace it back far enough it all comes from the Phoenicians, like English writing the same.
- Tim: Wow. 
- Tim: So it must be pretty big, then, Teluguland?
- Samuel: It is 23 provinces, Anna. But we are not rich as in the north, so many people here are still working for less than a hundred dollars a whole month.
- Tim: So what is the word for ""younger brother"" if ""Anna"" means ""elder brother?""

+ Dick: We're going to the apt now, wanna come and see
- Frank: Yeah, plus I can talk you into buying it, so we could be neighbours :)
- Dick: You know which one it is right? It's 32/3
- Frank: Ok, thanks. I know all the apts in building 32 are for sale, but I didn't know which one you wanted to buy.
- Dick: It's the big on with the terrace, around 85 m
- Frank: Grrr.... I'm jealous cause mine's only 65.
- Dick: :)
- Frank: If you decide to buy it, I have a contractor that does everything, and he's dirt cheap too!
- Dick: Cool, I'll be putting most of my cash in as a down payment, so I won't have much left for renovations.
- Frank: How much do you have, 10% or 15%.
- Dick: We're putting down 10. We can get quite a good mortgage rate apparently.
- Frank: Alright, sounds good. How many apts have you seen already?
- Dick: This will be the first one in this neighbourhood.
- Frank: But in total?
- Dick: 5. We saw 2 last week and 3 last month, but nothing really appealing,
- Frank: You're gonna love my area. It's so peaceful and tranquil.
- Dick: I'm gonna have to liven up the place then :)
- Frank: Ok, whatever. Don't forget to bring a measure. Do you have one of those electronic ones?
- Dick: No
- Frank: I'll bring one then. They're super cool and easy to use. You can plan each room by knowing the dimensions.
- Dick: Ok, great. See you in 30 min.
- Frank: Ok"

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.

- Kai: and then?
- Michael: I don’t have an answer to that one yet, and it’s not really a solution because I’d need to work 2 months notice period anyway, but I’ve just lost motivation after 3 years
- Kai: Would you like to leave London?
- Michael: yes asap
- Kai: for the Netherlands?
- Michael: maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don't want to stay there. I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative
- Kai: depends on the field. I don't know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also
- Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work?
- Kai: yes, I basically never rest these days
- Michael: that’s not good, you need rest to avoid a burnout, which I had just before I went on holiday
- Kai: Probably, I have a conference 8th of Dec, then I'll rest a bit, I hope."

- Camilla: Not much. Just some work and errands on Saturday, show Saturday night. Day of nothingness on Sundy.
- Charles: Sounds good. We are going to visit the German markets this weekend. Birmingham and Manchester both. Sausage overload!
- Camilla: Ooh, that sounds really good!
- Charles: Allegedly there are Christmas things going on but I just go for the sausage and beer!
- Camilla: What a shocker.

- Camilla: I'll have to try to get there this year. I've not been for ages.
- Charles: Oh, yeah, they are good. Try the mulled wine too. That's nice.
- Camilla: Never had it. Is it served hot?
- Charles: Yes, exactly. And lots of spices. Usually a red but sometimes they offer a mulled white.
- Camilla: I'm good with red.
- Charles: Inspired us to make our own at Christmas last year, but nobody else drank it.
- Camilla: Bummer!
- Charles: More for me! But oh the hangover.
- Camilla: LOL!
