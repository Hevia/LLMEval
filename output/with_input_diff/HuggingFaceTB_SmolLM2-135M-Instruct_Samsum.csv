- Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.
- Neela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!
- Clara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!
- Neela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.

- Leah: he was rly boring, but, you know, i didn't want to be rude, he didn't seem to be a psycho, so i kept talkig to him
- Leah: at one point he mentioned that ""we have something in common"", because we both speak german
- Samantha: charming :D
- Leah: i was like: ""erm, ok, how do you know about this, i don't know you, i didn't tell you about this""
- Leah: he just brushed it off and kept talking
- Leah: at one point he asked me about an event i had attended and he NAMED ALL OF MY FRIENDS THAT HAD COME WITH ME
- Leah: of course i didn't tell him about it
- Samantha: wow, that's creepy as hell
- Samantha: what did you do?
- Leah: i asked him once again how did he know about all this stuff and he said that he googled me out
- Samantha: WHAAAAT?
- Samantha: i googled people out before, but i’m not that stupid (and creepy) to tell them about it :o
- Leah: right?!
- Leah: and now the best part
- Leah: he googled me out, because he thought that i had a crush on him, because 2 weeks earlier  I LIKED A POST ON FB announcing that he was going to accompany poets on the guitar during the poetry reading
- Leah: can you believe this?!
- Samantha: LOOOOOOL
- Samantha: men are fckin weird
- Leah: AND he tried to walk me home, even though i told him straightforward that he was a creep
- Samantha: girl, you're lucky that he didn’t kill you, what a psycho

Clint: Sheer curiosity. What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.?
Ronnie: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants.
Clint: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here.

Clint: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow

- Kate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him
- Mary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say?
- Kate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it
- Mary: oh god
- Kate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck
- Mary: What did you tell him?
- Kate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.
- Mary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that
- Kate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once
- Mary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him
- Kate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself
- Kate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US
- Mary: Oh my god he said that?
- Kate: Yes :/
- Mary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much
- Kate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him
- Mary: No wonder"

- Casper: True, I saw that!

- Alexander: Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a little :D
- Casper: That's a fancy nickname, I like it
- Casper: But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus
- Igor: So... Judging from the overall tone of our discussion I feel that the decision's been already made
- Igor: Am I right, gentlemen?
- Casper: Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense
- Alexander: Not a bit!
- Alexander: And learning from Igor's last experience I think we should go somewhere else instead
- Alexander: I don't want to end up snoring and getting embarrassed :D

- Igor: So where are we going instead?
- Casper: Let's meet near the university and we'll work something out
- Igor: Agreed.

- Amber: B/c they only offered him the job after a month & during that time he started searching for a new one.
- Amber: He got a better offer from a different IT company in London.
- Erin: Well good for him! 
- Erin: Since they weren't able to appreciate his work and they didn't offer him something right away.
- Amber: Exactly, but you know what this means for me?
- Erin: You're going to have to search for a new flat...
- Amber: Yup, we had an agreement that I would be renting their place until they returned from Germany.
- Amber: But you know, they planned to be there for at least 5 yrs.
- Erin: I can imagine that Annie isn't happy with this turn of events.
- Amber: She's pretty pissed off.
- Amber: I mean the plan was to save up for a house and only then come back to London.
- Amber: She had already enrolled in German classes & they were starting to feel at home there.
- Erin: That's too bad. Sometimes life turns out to be unpredictable.
- Erin: If you need somewhere to stay for a while, you can always stay at my place.
- Amber: Thanks Erin! Annie already told me not to worry, that I can stay with them until I don't find something new.
- Amber: But I've already started searching.
- Erin: Good luck and let me know if you need any help!
- Amber: Thanks, ttyl.

- Yaz: Well, maybe not so serious after all then!
- Tania: Best to go there single, in my opinion!
- Yaz: Yeah, not got much choice in the matter. Maybe I'll meet my dream woman there!😀
- Tania: Why the hell not?! I can't wait to get out of here and up to Manchester, only 4 months and a bit, now!
- Yaz: Christ, that came around quick, just the little matter of A Levels and getting into Exeter to deal with. I need such high grades for my course, medicine is a cut-throat world.

Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. 
Betty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?
Andy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. 
Betty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!
