Neela: Why is it called Dear White People?
Clara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.

Neela: How's that?
Clara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.
Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.

Brenda: Well, yes, about 45 years ago, he was bald when he passed away. He loved to dance, he did Northern Soul, we both did actually. Went up to Wigan on weekends, happy times!
Sandra: Oh yes, I remember that craze, bit energetic for me! We liked disco instead! We had some great dinner dances with the factory, do you remember them?
Brenda: Yes! Us all dressed up with our long dresses and the men with their frilly evening shirts, lovely memories!
Sandra: Do you still see any of the girls from Lister's?
Brenda: No, but I heard that Marigold Carter died, very sad.
Sandra: Hey Bren, I've had a brainwave! How about we organise a reunion for the Lister's girls, look on social media for them?
Brenda: Actually, I was thinking along those lines! Do you fancy meeting up, just you and me? I can come down to Birmingham anytime.
Sandra: That would be lovely! Can you manage it next Saturday? We could meet about 11ish and go for lunch and a good old trip down memory lane!

- Gail: Right. And turned out that was everything she did. Never visited one. Never donated a dime. Never did anything.
- Julia: And all the time I thought she was so active and pro-active and charitable. She had me fooled ;)

The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested?
Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.
Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.
Noah: OK.
Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?

+ What did Maria say to her friend Spence?
- Maria: Hi Spence, life treating you well?
- Spencer: Can't complain love, lots of commissions coming in and all that!
- Maria: Getting your name out there! Saw some of your new stuff on Instagram, liked it!
- Spencer: Yeah, thanks love! How's the call centre?
- Maria: Same old, same old. Can't wait to go part time next year, really want to get on with some freelancing.
- Spencer: Yeah, pity they won't allow it for a year. I'm on 16 fixed hours at the cafe which suits me great. I've then got the rest of the week to work on my illustrations.
- Maria: How do you get new clients, Spence? I really need to pick your brains sometimes!
- Spencer: Well, some of them saw my printing in the shops I sell to and contacted me directly, then there's the agency and my social media stuff. I probably get around £1000  of work a month now, before commission and tax.
- Maria: Well that's just about liveable with the cafe wage, I imagine.
- Spencer: Yes, it's tight, but I am very frugal. Still have a hefty chunk going out on rent and bills.
- Maria: Hmm, I'll have to budget carefully when I do it.

Joe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic
Tim: Got it :D 
Joe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? 
Tim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... 
Joe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)
Tim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)

Gloria: Can't be better. I love your garden.
Mell: We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion.
Gloria: I'd love to. But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it.
Mell: We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose?
Gloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday?

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.
