Neela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?
Clara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.

- Jake: That's great! I'll keep my fingers crossed :)
- Catherine: Thanks Jake :) Is there anything I should prepare/review before the interview?
- Jake: Well I think it would be beneficial to know some facts about the company.
- Jake: You can find them on the official website, in the ""about us"" section:  <file_other> 
- Catherine: OK, I'll definitely take a look.
- Jake: And they may ask u some Qs about accounting principles, the basics. But I mean that won't be a problem 4 u.
- Jake: I remember u graduated with honours from uni.
- Catherine: That's true. :) I'm a bit nervous though.

Sophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?
Noah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!
Sophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.
Noah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.
Sophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?
Noah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of ""family care"" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.
Sophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!
Noah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.
Sophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?
Noah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.
Sophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.
Noah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.
Sophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.
Noah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.
Sophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?
Noah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!
Sophie: Thank you for the quince!","+  I'm sure they'll be back soon. I'll be sure to call you when they're back
- Noah: Hi there! The quince we talked about the other day... Are you still interested?
- Sophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.
- Noah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.
- Sophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.
- Sophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?
- Noah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.
- Sophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.

- Olivia: I don't really do much by way of post-production. I'm not exactly Steven Spielberg.
- Jake: I do, but I dont always have time to do much.
- Olivia: If I put in any music I always get a copyright strike and someone else is taking the ad revenue
- Jake: Yeah. And some of those claims are purely speculative. One time I put on one of my own pieces and it was challenged by Sony Music
- Olivia: No way!
- Jake: It's true. On the form you fill in to counter the claim I said if Sony want to make me one of their signed artists, that's fine. Otherwise to get they paws off of my music."

- Alexander: Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a little :D
- Casper: That's a fancy nickname, I like it
- Casper: But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus
- Igor: So... Judging from the overall tone of our discussion I feel that the decision's been already made
- Igor: Am I right, gentlemen?
- Casper: Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense
- Alexander: Not a bit!
- Alexander: And learning from Igor's last experience I think we should go somewhere else instead
- Alexander: I don't want to end up snoring and getting embarrassed :D

- Simon: The worst thing is that the country is being ostracized by defending it's values and interests. 
- Charlie: Yup. And as long as there are people in Poland ready to defend that values, the country will be marginalized by every other nation.
- Simon: I admire Poles.
- Simon: I admire them for they will to fight.
- Simon: They never give up.
- Charlie: Different countries tried to eliminate them from the map.
- Simon: I tell you, there will be time, when only Poland will have power to fight with internal problems of Europe.
- Charlie: Maybe. But there is a risk that internal conflict will rip the country apart.

I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.
Betty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? 
Andy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.
Betty: Why is that?
Andy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.
Betty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?
Andy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.
Betty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?
Andy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.
Betty: But why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?
Andy: I think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  
Betty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?
Andy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  
Betty: So what would you recommend?
Andy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. 
Betty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? 
Andy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.
Betty: OK, is this something your company can help with?
Andy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want.

- Mickey: What? Are u sure?
- Bobby: No, I'm not, but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness I have never heard of.
