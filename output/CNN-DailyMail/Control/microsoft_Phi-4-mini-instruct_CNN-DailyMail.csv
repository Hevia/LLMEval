## The Power of the Mind

*By Dr. David R","Raheem Sterling is currently earning less than half Mario Balotelli's salary .
Even signing new £100,000-a-week deal would only take him to parity .
Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has insisted Sterling will put pen to paper .
But he has assumed he'll stay at Liverpool when he has other ambitions .
Sterling should be playing in the Champions League .
And Liverpool, seven points off fourth place, may not be able to offer that .
Adrian Durham: Arsenal only turn it on when the pressure is off .
Durham: Rooney and Carrick are Man Utd's only players with the 'football intelligence' demanded by Louis van Gaal .
CLICK HERE for all the latest Liverpool news .
Raheem Sterling is a very good player .
He's been performing at a high level consistently for two seasons .
If a club is prepared to pay £50m he would play regularly for them .
There would be no shortage of clubs wanting to sign him – Real Madrid have already said they are monitoring his situation .
Rodgers says they won't sell this summer, but it's more bluster I'm afraid. Common sense dictates they can't afford to let his contract run down to its final year. The situation needs to be addressed .
Sterling wants to play Champions League football.
