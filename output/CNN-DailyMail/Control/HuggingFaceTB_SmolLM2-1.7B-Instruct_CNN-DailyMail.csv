Yellowstone Area Bar Association President Jessica Fehr said Thursday that Baugh was chosen for the award by the group's board of directors .
Baugh, 73, sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher .
He sentenced Stacey Rambold to just one month in prison in the case .
At the sentencing, Baugh said 14-year-old Cherice Moralez was 'as much in control of the situation' as Rambold .
He also described Moralez as 'older than her chronological age' and called her a troubled youth .
Moralez killed herself before the case went to trial .
After prosecutors appealed, Rambold was re-sentenced in September and is serving 10 years in Montana State Prison. He is appealing the sentence .","{'Min_10.0% Prob': 7.928974719274612, 'Min_20.0% Prob': 6.214494211333139, 'Min_30.0% Prob': 5.197712606853909, 'Min_40.0% Prob': 4.483028128033593, 'Min_50.0% Prob': 3.911777603058588}",0.6506026983261108,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.06802721088435375, recall=0.7692307692307693, fmeasure=0.12500000000000003), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.03424657534246575, recall=0.4166666666666667, fmeasure=0.06329113924050633), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.061224489795918366, recall=0.6923076923076923, fmeasure=0.1125)}",821,0,0.0473275234720458,Clean,0,0.3224688944424159,Clean,0,0.2171048396048396,Clean,0,0.047327523472045885,Not Contaminated,0,0.32246889444241594,Not Contaminated,0,0.21710483960483962,Not Contaminated
