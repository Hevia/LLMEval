##Your task: **Rewrite** the above paragraph into a middle school level textbook section","This is the third part of our major Good Health series on dementia .
We look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems .
For example, we need just as much sleep as we get older .
The problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep .
When the short-term memory starts to go, it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day, such as whether they've had breakfast, or showered, or spoken to someone.
It can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day. Writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes, which can help slow down future decline.
Create a memory hub - that is, a central place in the home, perhaps the dining room table or a desk, where important notes, car keys, house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept. Put things here that you want to be able to find quickly. Get into the habit of having everything in this one place rather than having things scattered about the home.
Get a whiteboard or blackboard - that can be used to record a timetable of what needs to be done each day that week. Things that get done can be ticked off. It is another way to show what has been done, but also shows what remains to be done.
Label doors, drawers, cupboards and cabinets to avoid confusion about what goes where.
Have a list of the numbers of key people by the phone - your GP and other care professionals, carers, family and reliable friends.
Have a daily newspaper delivered - it is a simple way of keeping aware of what is happening in the world and is a useful reminder of that day's date.
When showering or having a bath, establish a routine as a reminder of whether your hair has been washed. For example, move the conditioner and shampoo from one side of the bath to the other once you've used them.
Eat regular meals. While other body cells can take fuel from elsewhere, the brain relies on a good supply of glucose from the blood. That's why skipping a meal can affect reasoning, cognition and memory.
In the early stages of dementia, begin a reminiscence book to act as a reminder of key events in that person's life and who people are. It's a nice thing for the person with dementia and a loved one to do together. Include pictures and snippets of information and date and label every entry.","{'Min_10.0% Prob': 7.239921875, 'Min_20.0% Prob': 5.981919090346534, 'Min_30.0% Prob': 5.148103412828948, 'Min_40.0% Prob': 4.504627847906404, 'Min_50.0% Prob': 3.981453001968504}",0.0779691636562347,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.009237875288683603, recall=0.3076923076923077, fmeasure=0.017937219730941707), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.0, recall=0.0, fmeasure=0.0), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.006928406466512702, recall=0.23076923076923078, fmeasure=0.013452914798206277)}",2228,1.0,0.7794648243559189,Contaminated,1.0,0.6407145887585779,Contaminated,1.0,0.6706923517234539,Contaminated,1.0,0.7794648243559189,Likely Contaminated,1.0,0.6407145887585779,Likely Contaminated,1.0,0.6706923517234539,Likely Contaminated
