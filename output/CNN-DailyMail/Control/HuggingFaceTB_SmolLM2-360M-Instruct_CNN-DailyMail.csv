Labour's business leaders, including 120 former and current corporate executives","Shadow Cabinet ministers brand industry leaders as members of the '1%'
Lord Prescott suggests they are 'tax dodgers, Tory donors and non doms'
One of them, Diageo boss Paul Walsh, 'should no longer take over at CBI'
103 corporate leaders declared Government 'has been good for business'
In September 2011, Miliband marks his first year as Labour leader by threatening a more punitive system of tax and regulation for businesses that he considers to be ‘predators’ who are ‘just interested in the fast buck’.
The Institute of Directors says: ‘We would like to know how he plans to identify and reward “good” companies over “bad” ones. He should have more faith in customers and investors to decide’.
In his 2013 conference speech he pledges an incoming Labour government would freeze gas and electricity bills for 20 months.
Power firms say it will deter investment in much needed infrastructure. Energy UK says the policy risks making ‘energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for everyone’.
Also that month Miliband announces councils should be allowed to fine developers if they acquire land with planning permission but do not build on it immediately. Town halls would also be able to buy and grant planning permission on land held by developers.
The IoD says the ‘use it or lose it’ declaration is a ‘Stalinist attack on property rights’. The Home Builders Federation says it ‘completely rejects’ the idea land is being hoarded.
In January 2014, Labour vows it will reverse George Osborne’s cut in the 50p rate of tax for anyone earning more than £150,000 – which, with disingenuous class war rhetoric, it dubs a ‘tax cut for millionaires’.
In a letter, the heads of 24 of Britain’s most successful companies say this would put the economic recovery at risk.
In September 2014 Labour pledges to reverse a 1p cut in corporation tax.
The IoD hits back: ‘It’s a dangerous move for Labour to risk our business-friendly environment in this way.’
In February Miliband and his supporters turn on Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina when he dares to say he fears Labour’s business policies will be a catastrophe. Pessina is labelled a tax avoider from Monaco.

President Barack Obama addressed Republican candidate Scott Walker during an interview on NPR's Morning Edition","The president took a jab at the Wisconsin governor during an interview with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep .
Obama was responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office .

Walker fired back on Twitter: 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them'

Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots player, was found guilty","Alexander Bradley, a key witness in the Aaron Hernandez murder trial, told the jury on Wednesday the football star had access to the murder weapon .
Bradley claimed he saw someone hand Hernandez a black Glock pistol in a Miami hotel .
Bradley, who says he was Hernandez's former drug dealer and then best friend, was not allowed to testify that Hernandez shot him in the eye .
Prosecutors had contended the February shooting is relevant to the Lloyd murder since it shows that Hernandez had no trouble shooting his friends .
Bradley is currently suing Hernandez for shooting him .
During one sidebar Bradley stared directly at Hernandez, who refused to make eye contact .
The prosecution in the case is expected to rest tomorrow .

Despite getting over 400,000 likes, the post drew criticism that she was insincere and unable to relate to the issues due to her privileged background .
Other critics felt she should focus her prayers elsewhere, such as the victims of the Nepal earthquake .
Just 30 minutes later she tweeted that she was: 'Damned if I do. Damned if I don't', and asked: 'Now it's wrong to pray?'

The death of Little Zane Gbangola, a 4-year","Zane Gbangbola died at home in the middle of the night after gas poisoning .
Authorities denied that deadly fumes were coming from nearby landfill site .
They insisted carbon monoxide from faulty pump in house caused his death .
Evidence shows authorities knew hydrogen cyanide leaked into family home .
Fire crews fled the riverside home for their own safety after their specialist gas detectors sounded the alarm for dangerous levels of hydrogen cyanide four hours after Zane was discovered by his mother.
The concentration of the gas found could be fatal within 15 minutes; .
Carbon monoxide was never detected in the family's home; .
Neighbours were evacuated amid fears of 'contamination from floodwater'; .

Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner, Susan Daub,","Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner Susan Daub are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators .
They allegedly reaped over $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes .
Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins .
The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes .
