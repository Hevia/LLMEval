deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail, The exterior of the Audi TT is very similar to the new 2.0 TFSI S,"We've enjoyed some of the highest temperatures of the year this week .
The range starts at £31,995 and the Audi can cost as much as £50,000 .
No matter how good, the new Audi TT still has nothing on the 1999 model .
With the sunshine beaming this week and some of the highest temperatures recorded so far this year, what better moment to splash out on the new third-generation Audi TT Roadster. It goes on sale this month. Just the time to get the roof off on this softtop German sports car, which has established itself as a firm favourite in the 16 years it has been on the road.
I drove the fully stocked four-wheel-drive 2-litre TFSI in S-line quattro trim with 230 bhp, which was adept at whipping around the Cotswolds in style.
Sure-footed and fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 seconds up to a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph. CO2 emissions are a fair 154g/km.
Supportively cossetting sports seats leave you sitting comfortably at the wheel.
A nicely tuned exhaust pipe gives the TT Roadster a most satisfying 'brrrm brrrm'.
You won't break the bank at the filling station. Even with the satisfying performance you'll average 43.5mpg, rising to 52.3mpg when cruising and still managing a respectable 33.6 mpg around town.
Great wind-in-the-hair motoring with a top that will come down in ten seconds at speeds of up to 31mph, and a more streamlined body.
It's easy to make a hands-free phone call with the automatic three-layer fabric hood down because microphones are embedded in the safety belt.
Auto-dim LED headlights have been transferred across from the flagship Audi A8 saloon.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Though this version is on an allnew platform, the progression is evolution, not revolution.
The car I drove cost well in excess of £50,000. The range starts from £31,995 for the 2-litre TDi Sport in six-speed manual.
The optional open-top driving package includes head-level heating to keep your bonce from getting chilly, an electrically operated wind deflector, which stops parky draughts whistling behind your neck, and handily heated super sports seats.
No matter how good, nothing will have the jaw-dropping impact on the car market as the original Audi TT of 1999. It was dubbed the 'Bauhaus Bullet' because of its clean, minimalist lines reminiscent of the German art movement of the Twenties and early Thirties.
Hefty prestige price tag. The base price of the car I drove was £41,630. But it was loaded up with extras adding another £13,000 — or the price of a half-decent family runaround.
These include an open-top driving package (£1,000), rotorgrey fine Nappa leather and super-sports seats (£1,390), a comfort and sound package (£1,590), technology package (£1,795), electric front seats (£995), 19 in twin-spoke alloy wheels (£450), metallic paint (£545), and LED headlights (£945).","{'Min_10.0% Prob': 12.520440924657533, 'Min_20.0% Prob': 10.426771190068493, 'Min_30.0% Prob': 8.890714183789955, 'Min_40.0% Prob': 7.6396417487157535, 'Min_50.0% Prob': 6.63537931181694}",0.6143087148666382,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.022900763358778626, recall=0.75, fmeasure=0.044444444444444446), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.0076481835564053535, recall=0.26666666666666666, fmeasure=0.01486988847583643), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.02099236641221374, recall=0.6875, fmeasure=0.040740740740740744)}"

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail," The Niva is a tough, reliable vehicle, but it's not for everyone. The Lada","This 4x4 from Russia is a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover .
Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears .
But, forget luxuries because the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone .
A highly capable, ruftytufty 4x4 from Russia — for a fraction of the price of a new Land Rover.
It's a confident charmer that stands out from the crowd, with high suspension, pressed steel wheels, Soviet-style looks and real rarity value. Expect to get gawped at: someone offered to buy mine on its second trip out. Always fun.
Now available in the UK from Niva imports through its dealer, BB Motors, in Corby, Northamptonshire (01536 202207, lada4x4.co.uk).
On the road, the basic 1.7-litre petrol engine (your only option) is deafeningly noisy, but tolerably smooth. Power steering, manageable dimensions and a tight turning circle make it reasonably practical for the supermarket or school run.
The seats are comfy and thanks to a high driving position and large wing mirrors, all-round visibility is good. Top speed is 91 mph.
Off-road, the Niva is in its element, with low and highrange gears, differential lock and a sturdy monocoque construction. It is lighter and more sprightly in the mud than many big-name utility 4x4s, with 220mm ground clearance, a 600mm wading depth and a climbing ability of up to 58 per cent. Tall, slender tyres give it an added advantage when things get mucky.
You won't have to agonise over pages of extras... they're more or less nonexistent. This is a very basic utility vehicle, after all.
Choose in white, blue, green or red, then decide whether you'd like the snorkel or snow plough (really) attachments. An LPG option is available for an extra £999 — but you lose boot space.
Reasonable fuel economy at 33mpg and affordable to insure — once you've explained exactly what it is. Meets Euro 5 emissions standards. The heated blower, presumably designed with Siberia in mind, has plenty of muscle for icy winter mornings.
Also available in a compact van format (£10,590, excluding VAT and road tax).
Spartan on the inside. Forget luxuries such as radios, cup-holders, central locking and electric windows — the Niva is an unabashed frills-free zone. The upside of its simplicity is that the plastic interior is easy to mop down after a day in the mud, and there's not much to break or go wrong.
There are only four seatbelts and a slightly pokey boot.
Don't trust the petrol gauge, which regularly aims to deceive.
No warranty is offered as standard — although a two-year plan is coming soon — and spares may need to be imported (BB Motors will assist).
Only available in lefthand drive — unless you put in an order for more than 500 of them!
Shhhh! You didn't hear it from me. But patriotic Russian President Vladimir Putin made a big play of driving a Lada Niva back in 2009 — but fitted it with a German engine.","{'Min_10.0% Prob': 12.126004464285714, 'Min_20.0% Prob': 10.24071919326241, 'Min_30.0% Prob': 8.956531398104266, 'Min_40.0% Prob': 7.841138907358156, 'Min_50.0% Prob': 6.929487748579546}",0.6424643993377686,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.023483365949119372, recall=0.8, fmeasure=0.04562737642585551), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.00980392156862745, recall=0.35714285714285715, fmeasure=0.019083969465648856), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.021526418786692758, recall=0.7333333333333333, fmeasure=0.041825095057034224)}"
