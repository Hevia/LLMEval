lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"The court heard that after booking the holiday, Graham had found a new girlfriend, Elizabeth Todd, 51, with whom he had become infatuated. It was around the day of her intended departure on June 17 that Ms Brown was murdered. Jurors were told that Graham wanted Miss Brown’s money so he could ‘live a lifestyle that involved owning and driving powerful motor cars’ and buy a property for Todd to live in. During his murder trial at Newcastle Crown Court, the jury heard Ms Brown had been besotted with 'greedy liar' Graham (pictured in long leather jacket) The trial judge said Ms Brown, whose body has never been found, may have been dumped in a deep pit or mine shaft by former JCB digger driver Graham. Her killer was badly in debt and was struggling to fund the finance agreements on his beloved sports cars. He plundered Ms Brown's bank account to fund his flashy lifestyle, making her elderly parents, Eric and Olive Brown, believe their daughter was still alive by sending them letters and cards in her name from Europe. Graham also ingratiated himself with her parents after her death and started systematically stripping their estate and assets. He used his visits to gain access to Ms Brown's security codes and also sold her Porsche and other cars. When her parents died, he plundered their bank accounts - defrauding a total of more than £500,000 from them. The couple died in 2007 and 2008 respectively, believing their only daughter was working in a bank in Switzerland. After they died building society staff eventually became suspicious that withdrawals were still being made in 2010 and police were called. They believed they were just investigating a fraud but it soon became apparent Ms Brown was missing and a murder inquiry was launched. He hadn't worked since an accident in 1997 when a JCB bucket hit him on the back and he was awarded £40,000 compensation. Graham was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for killing Ms Brown. Northumbria Police subsequently launched an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act into his finances. Graham stole more than £800,000 from Ms Brown to fund his love of supercars and a lavish lifestyle. The court heard with his fleet of flash sports cars and his large imposing house on a hill, pony-tailed and goatee-bearded Graham thought of himself as a charmer and cut a distinctive figure in his long leather coat. He liked to play the big man, pretending to be related to murdered Viv Graham who was shot and killed in an unsolved apparent gangland hit in 1993, in an effort to enhance his reputation as a force to be reckoned with. In fact he was a failed former policeman in the Met, having quit after a week in the 1970s, apparently homesick for his native North East. The court heard Graham's main motivation in life was always money and he had a penchant for women over whom he could exert power and control.","Donald Graham, 62, murdered his wealthy heiress lover for her money .

It is powered by two Eurojet EJ200 engines and is 49ft (15 metres) long from tip to tip. The material is 'no more than the thickness of a match stick.' This helps its ‘fly by wire’ computer system to accurately control the aircraft, designed to be unstable but hugely agile. The Typhoon can take off in less than 8 seconds, achieve supersonic speeds in under 30 seconds and reach altitudes of 36,000 feet Mach 1.6 in under two and a half minutes. It is able to pull up to 9G, which creates a pressure on the wings equivalent to 30 African elephants. The Typhoon is one of the most perfectly aligned fast jet airframes in the world.","To counteract shifts in gravitational pull, engineers build Typhoon on 'floating' concrete rafts with laser trackers and computer-automated jacks .

The EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, will today serve Google with a formal charge sheet alleging that it breached anti-trust rules. Google has previously rejected the allegations, and insisted that Android is an open platform that is distributed for free. The investigation into Google began in 2010 but was repeatedly delayed because the commission could not agree on settlement terms. Google offered three settlement proposals to resolve the case. Most recently, just over a year ago, it offered to give competing products and services bigger visibility on its website. However, Europe initially accepted that deal, only to reverse the decision six months later and demand more concessions. If Google fails to rebut any formal charges imposed by Brussels, the commission could impose a huge fine which could exceed £4 billion - about 10 per cent of Google's most recent annual revenue. The move will stop short of previous threats that the EU executive could consider breaking up Google to separate its business from the search engine.","The European Union will accuse Google of illegally abusing its supremacy .

The satellite's radar imaging technology allows it to see through cloud and rain, and in the dark, making it particularly useful for monitoring earthquakes and for providing images for emergency response. The satellite is part of the Copernicus environment-monitoring programme, which is led by the European Commission. The programme's data is used for a variety of applications, including monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change, and responding to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes. The satellite's swath width of 155 miles (250km) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan. The entire area will be covered under the same geometry every 12 days, allowing for the wider region to be regularly monitored for changes in the land.","The satellite, Sentinel-1a,  sends out radio waves and times how long it takes for them to reflect back .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"The England C team is facing the axe after 36 years as part of Greg Dyke’s spending review at the Football Association. FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23 . Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level.","Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to find the needed £30million .

The page has more than 450 members who share their pictures, videos and stories about Jack and keep up to date with his daily activities. Jack was hand-reared by a vet as a chick in 2013 after being discovered with no feathers, before being released into the wild. He then started popping into homes and gardens but has since broadened his network to a ten-mile radius, visiting houses and flats and even college and university campuses, offices, schools and sports clubs. He has become so relaxed around humans that he regularly falls asleep in the laps and hands of residents. He taps on windows to signal he has arrived and even pops into supermarkets and perches on trolleys as residents shop. Locals, who keep bird food and treats in their homes, are able to distinguish him from other jackdaws because of a silver tag tied to his right leg. Grace Chapman-Duke, a 20-year-old student, got to know Jack well before moving house. She said: ‘He used to be my personal alarm clock every day. He would tap on my window to let me know he was there. ‘Once I let him in, he would sit on my shoulder as I got ready for uni and then would continue on my shoulder until I got to my lecture. Jack was hand-reared as a chick after being discovered with no feathers, before being released into the wild . 'Our friendship progressed to such a degree that he would perch on my shoulder as I showered.’ One resident wrote on Facebook: ‘I used to go into the kitchen on a wet winter’s day to find he had sneaked through the window and was asleep on the back of the chair! Joined us for Christmas dinner and all sorts.’ Bird specialist Lloyd Buck, who trains birds for film and TV productions, said: ‘It sounds as though this bird has developed the bond it would normally have with birds with humans.’","Jack Black the friendly jackdaw is a welcome resident in Penryn, Cornwall .

But by December 2014, more than two out of three NHS hospitals were in the red. Last year, nineteen NHS trusts were referred to ministers after auditors raised concerns about their financial health. One of those referred was Hinchingbrooke, which is the first hospital trust to be run by a private firm, Circle. Despite the growing crisis in funding for NHS England, the SNP has demanded even more cash for Scotland. Dr David Stewart, the medical director for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said the South Glasgow University Hospital 'allows us to truly bring healthcare into the 21st Century' .

The former head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson delivered a stark warning earlier this month over the black hole in hospital finances.

'It's all about perspective, cause it gets hard,' she said in a Boston Children's Hospital video. 'You just kind of have to see the finish line and keep and eye on where you're going and why you're doing this.' Violet Pietrok, a two-year-old girl from Portland, Oregon, was born with frontonasal dysplasia, a rare congenital malformation that caused her facial features to widen, specifically her nose and the space between her eyes. The condition also caused a central cleft in her face and a growth over her left eye. Violet's eyes were originally so far apart that her vision was like that of a bird of prey's. Plastic surgeon-in-chief Dr. John Meara of Boston Children's Hospital spent months preparing for Violet's surgery with molds of her skull that were made using a 3D printer. The molds allowed Meara and the other surgeons to see what possible problems could arise with certain methods and gave them a fuller picture of what they were working with. Meara used the molds during the almost seven-hour surgery and referenced them when the doctors tried to find solutions for a complication. Violet's new face allows her to be just as expressive as any of the other children her age. It took a 'little while' for Violet to get back to normal as she spent six weeks recovering from the operation in the hospital and adjusting to her new vision perception. The surgery took more than three months to heal, and there were physical complications, one which sent Violet back to the operating room. But her stitches were finally removed at the end of February, just in time for Violet's second birthday. And she has been smiling the whole way through.","Violet Pietrok was born with congenital facial malformation called frontonasal dysplasia .

The vessels can be activated within 20 days to four months, in order to provide shipping during national emergencies, either military or non-military, such as commercial shipping crises. Throughout its first thirty years, the National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels were activated to help transporting coal and grains in times of shortage, and ships were brought in during the Korean War, the 1961 Berlin crisis and the Vietnam War. After the fall of Saigon in 1975, the National Defense Reserve Fleet was augmented by the Ready Reserve Fleet (RFF) to provide for military emergencies. Since then, ships have been activated to support U.S. troops and transport cargo in the Gulf War in 1990 and aided in several humanitarian disasters in the new millennium. In 2005, four National Defense Reserve Fleet ships were used for relief operations in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and five years later, six were used in the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti. Its most recent operation took place in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, when two National Defense Reserve Fleet training vessels were called in. As of April 30, 2014, only 122 vessels are left in the NDRF, and their numbers are reducing still.","The United States' National Defense Reserve Fleet was set up after the Second World War in 1945 .

The document is likely to be seen as an attempt by the Tories to tap into growing English nationalism, with opponents warning it risks fostering division between the UK’s four nations. But a Tory strategist said: ‘We have separate Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish manifestos. Why shouldn’t there be one for England?’ The ‘English votes’ plan would seek to resolve a longstanding constitutional question which will become more urgent than ever once the Scottish Parliament is handed yet more powers. Mr Hague wants to strip Scottish MPs of the power to impose tax changes, education and health reforms on England, given Holyrood will soon control all these issues in Scotland. The reform would make it impossible for any future Labour government to press ahead with its plans to raise the top rate of tax to 50p in England without winning the support of a majority of English MPs. Tensions: The manifesto is expected to inflame tensions between the Tories and nationalist parties like Nicola Sturgeon's SNP and Plaid Cymru, led by Leanne Wood. It could also make it difficult for a Scottish MP to again hold the office of Chancellor or Prime Minister, given they would be unable to vote on some of their own Government’s legislation. For decades, Labour has relied on the votes of its power base of Scottish MPs to rule Westminster. But since the creation of the Scottish Parliament, critics have questioned how it can be right for Scots MPs to have the crucial say on issues such as tuition fees and foundation hospitals which no longer affect their constituents. Both reforms passed under Tony Blair’s government thanks to the votes of Labour’s tartan army of MPs. Mr Hague is expected to say that the scale of devolution now to be given to Scotland means the question of the status of Scottish MPs at Westminster is unavoidable. He will say: ‘The English are being held to ransom by the SNP. ‘We need to ensure that the English have a voice in the UK Parliament. ‘We need to ensure that the English are not held to ransom by the SNP.’","Chancellor warns global investors fear impact of SNP in UK government .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"Manchester United have been linked with Cavani but the striker hasn't impressed this season . Radamel Falcao has struggled at Manchester United after signing on loan from Ligue 1 side Monaco . And the painful, expensive experience of Radamel Falcao's nightmare loan spell will have made the club's Dutch manager wary of seemingly-fading South Americans. But United, who have cash to burn and gaps to fill, will have kept a close eye on Tuesday night's events at the Nou Camp to see if Cavani still had what it takes. On the evidence of a sterile 90 minutes in an inevitable 2-0 defeat he does not. There is mitigation – Barcelona look unstoppable and few in Europe can live with Luis Enrque's resurgent treble hunters. Questions over Cavani's domestic form, however, still linger. France's Ligue 1 is not the Premier League or La Liga and after making the £55m move from Napoli, where he was almost unplayable, Cavani has not been the prolific force officials at Parc des Princes hoped for. This season he has played 32 times in domestic competitions and has scored 11 goals, although six more have come in the Champions League. Louis van Gaal prefers to work with younger players and may have been put off Cavani by Falcao's spell . The Uruguayan hasn't scored as many goals as he should have done in the French league . PSG will now concentrate on winning a two-horse race with Lyon at the top of the table (they are currently level on points with a game in hand) and will look to Cavani along with Zlatan Ibrahimovic to fire them over the line first. Following the 3-1 first leg defeat by Barcelona on home soil the man himself maintained he wants to see out the remainder of his contract in France. 'There is too much talk about my future but I will remain here,' he told Sky Italia. 'I will respect my contract and I'm only focusing on doing well for PSG.' He may have few options to do anything else.","Edinson Cavani struggled in both legs for PSG against Barcelona .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"The article discusses the challenges faced by carers of people with dementia and provides tips on how to make life easier for both the carers and their loved ones. It emphasizes the importance of establishing routines, understanding behavior changes, and providing support to help carers cope with the demands of caring for someone with dementia.","This is the final week of our major Good Health series on dementia .
We turn our attention to carers and what can be done to make life easier .
In England there are more than 670,000 unpaid carers helping someone .
We explain what to if they become anxious as the light starts to fade .
Bed and getting-up times.
When to take medication.
Meal times.
Shopping days.
Leisure time such as TV, radio or social times.
Before you start talking always engage eye contact to help get the person with dementia to focus on you. There can be a tendency for them to look away and this makes it harder for them to concentrate on the conversation.
Be careful about asking questions they may be unable to process. For example, if they're upset don't ask what's wrong as they may not know, or are unable to put it into words. Instead, tell them: 'You seem to be upset; let's think how we can make you feel better.'
Finishing sentences for them can increase frustration. It's better to ask if they'd like you to find words for them if they're having difficulty.
Watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they are feeling. For example, repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared, while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed.
If they're doing something obviously wrong, for example putting dishes in the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard, don't ask them why or castigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected and pointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration.","{'Min_10.0% Prob': 8.92483108108108, 'Min_20.0% Prob': 7.288333333333333, 'Min_30.0% Prob': 6.100836559734513, 'Min_40.0% Prob': 5.213951262417218, 'Min_50.0% Prob': 4.491867146164021}",0.7223802208900452,"{'rouge1': Score(precision=0.10320284697508897, recall=0.5272727272727272, fmeasure=0.17261904761904762), 'rouge2': Score(precision=0.02142857142857143, recall=0.1111111111111111, fmeasure=0.03592814371257485), 'rougeL': Score(precision=0.060498220640569395, recall=0.3090909090909091, fmeasure=0.10119047619047618)}",1287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 34-year-old supermodel made her final catwalk appearance at São Paulo Fashion Week on Wednesday, wearing a white embroidered halterneck dress and a selection of summery ensembles. Bundchen, who is married to NFL quarterback Tom Brady, has said she wants to spend more time with her family but has also vowed to continue working in the industry. She made her big entrance with the lights dimmed - apart from the glow of a neon Colcci logo behind her - and launched down the catwalk to the beat of an uptempo indie-rock track. The mother-of-two sizzled in a pretty white embroidered halterneck dress along with some black knee-high gladiator-style boots. Her golden blonde tresses were styled into her signature beachy waves and her make-up palette was natural with a nude lip. After 20 years of striding with pride, Giselle Bundchen finishes her runway career at Colcci, a Brazilian fashion brand, in a stunning sheer white halter neck dress. This kind of dress is a must have for summer. Throw it over a bikini for the beach or style it just like the runway over a black cage bra and gladiator heels for the ultimate rocker boho music festival look. Colcci style is heavily influenced by street wise clothing, with a hint of hip hop culture as well as Mexican folk art. They have one store in New Jersey and they're a hard brand to find online. Not to worry, if you're not heading to Brazil anytime soon, we found several sheer breezy dresses that will have you ready for your summer entrance.

I am so proud of you and everything you have accomplished on the runway. I have never met someone with more of a will to succeed and determination to overcome any obstacle in the way. You never cease to amaze me. Nobody loves life more then you and your beauty runs much deeper then what the eye can see. I can’t wait to see what’s next. I love you. ‪#‎GOAT‬ ‪#‎thebestisyettocome.'

They all sported white T-shirts bearing the chiseled face of Gisele herself. Gisele flashed her toned tummy as she raised her arms to cheer alongside her catwalk crew and looked emotional as she bid farewell to the catwalk. Before she took to the spotlight on Wednesday, Gisele sipped on a cocktail while backstage of the show. 'Almost ready,' the supermodel captioned an image of her holding a giant piece of fruit with a straw in it as she got ready in her dressing room.

The Bali Nine ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed on Wednesday after spending 10 years on death row for trying to smuggle heroin from Bali to Australia in 2005. The executions sparked outrage from human rights groups and the Australian government, which had been lobbying for clemency for the two men. Despite their rehabilitation, the pair were shot dead by a firing squad in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The executions have been criticized by the Australian government and human rights groups, who say the death penalty is cruel and inhumane. The families of the condemned men endured harrowing goodbyes with the two Australian men in last visits in prison on Tuesday. Sukuraman's sister, Brintha, could not stifle her wails as she made her way through the crowds of people outside the gates of the port where they embarked for the prison. Moments later, Chan's mother Helen arrived outwardly sobbing and had to be carried away from the media scrum as police officers led the family through the crowd.","Heather Mack avoided the death penalty last week for murdering her mother and stuffing body in suitcase at Bali hotel in August .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"The city has experienced a series of earthquakes in 2013 and 2014, which were caused by nearby oil and gas operations. The oil and gas industry uses injection wells to dispose of wastewater, which can contain chemicals, heavy metals, salt, and radioactive material. Scientists have linked the earthquakes to the high-pressure injection of drilling wastewater into the ground. The study was conducted by researchers from Southern Methodist University and the US Geological Survey. The study found that the timing and location of the earthquakes correlated better with the drilling and injection activities than with any other possible reason. The study also found that the removal of brine from the ground did not have a significant impact on the earthquake activity. The study's findings add to other research that has linked the injection of wastewater from energy wells to an increase in earthquakes in Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The US Geological Survey has reported that there have been more than 950 magnitude 2 or higher earthquakes in Oklahoma and southern Kansas so far this year, which is more than double the number reported for the same period last year.","Azle has recently been shaken by 27 quakes with magnitude two or greater .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"Can is German, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture . Sterling has played in various positions this season under Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers - including as a striker and at wing back . Among the reasons advanced for Sterling’s coldness towards a long-term commitment at Liverpool has been Rodgers’s recent decision to play him at right wing back. This has been a result of injuries and suspensions, rather than a long-term strategy - but it does raise wider questions regarding the mindset of English players, and why many might find their pathway blocked. Would a young player brought up through Ajax’s system, for instance, be so affronted by this temporary change? Why is it the English in particular that see football in straight lines? Sterling has played as a centre forward, a No 10, a wide midfielder and now a wing back. Isn’t this the versatility that we envy in the best foreign teams? Isn’t this an education? Why is it that England produces pigeon-holed full backs or midfielders, and not footballers? Shouldn’t a player - certainly one who wishes to command in excess of £100,000 a week - be able to fill in anywhere? Indeed, shouldn’t he welcome that endorsement from his manager? Arsenal progressed to the 2006 Champions League final at a time when Ashley Cole was injured. In his place through the knockout stages, home and away against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal, was the 22-year-old French midfielder Mathieu Flamini. He hadn’t played full back in his entire professional career, he said. But he never complained, and Arsenal didn’t concede in any of his six matches. Midfielder Mathieu Flamini (right) was used as a full back in Arsenal's run to the 2006 Champions League final . Flamini isn’t a creative player in Sterling’s mould - but then right wing back isn’t the same as left back, either. Sterling is still operating as a winger when Liverpool attack. Flamini, a central midfielder, was used strictly as a defender. It wasn’t as if Arsene Wenger was gung-ho in those games: three ended goalless, two in 1-0 victories. Flamini performed with exceptional discipline. One imagines that midfielder Emre Can didn’t sign for Liverpool expecting to be part of a back three. Rodgers first used him as a defender this season against Burnley in December, and he has remained there ever since. Can is German, though, the product of a more intellectually vibrant football culture. World Cup-winning captain Philipp Lahm eagerly switched between holding midfield and full back. Midfield lynchpin Bastian Schweinsteiger began his career as a right winger, while Thomas Muller can play centre forward, support striker, attacking midfielder and winger. Every player will have a favourite position but in England these desires become entrenched. Even the most gifted, such as Steven Gerrard, never seemed entirely at ease with his versatility. Maybe Sterling should spend his time thinking less about his contract and more about the type of footballer he wishes to be; maybe about the type of footballer who can demand more than £100,000 a week. Because that player goes wherever his team needs him — and that makes him worth the coin.","Raheem Sterling has turned down a Liverpool deal worth £100,000-a-week .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has hailed the victims of the massacre at a Kenyan university earlier this week as martyrs during his Easter Sunday sermon. Speaking at Canterbury Cathedral, the Most Rev Justin Welby said the 148 mainly Christian victims of Thursday's brutal mass-murders were 'witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word.' Pope Francis made similar statements during Easter Sunday Mass at St Peter's Square in the Vatican, where he also made a nod to the recent agreement between Iran and the international community over its nuclear power, calling it a 'step toward a more secure and fraternal world.' Religious holiday: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivers his sermon during the Easter Day service at Canterbury Cathedral, Kent . 'Martyrs': The Most Rev Justin Welby said the nearly 150 victims of the university massacre in Kenya were 'witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word' Religious leader: Pope Francis waves before delivering his 'Urbi et Orbi'(to the city and the world) message, where he prayed for an end to the persecution of Christians, from the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square after Easter Mass . Long wait: Thousands had gathered in St Peter's Square to hear the Pope, despite heavy rain and thunderstorms on Sunday morning . The Archbishop said Christians must resist without violence the persecution they suffer and support persecuted communities, with love and goodness and generosity. And he said: 'To witness is to be a martyr. I am told by the Coptic Bishop in England that the Coptic Christians murdered in Libya last month died proclaiming that Jesus Christ is Lord. They are martyrs, a word that means both one that dies for their faith and one that witnesses to faith. 'There have been so many martyrs in the last year. On Maundy Thursday, three days ago, around 150 Kenyans were killed because of being Christian. They are witnesses, unwilling, unjustly, wickedly, and they are martyrs in both senses of the word.' He added: 'These martyrs too are caught up in the resurrection: their cruel deaths, the brutality of their persecution, their persecution is overcome by Christ himself at their side because they share his suffering, at their side because he rose from the dead. 'Because of the resurrection of Jesus from the dead the cruel are overcome, evil is defeated, martyrs conquer.' Pope Francis delivers his Easter message from the central loggia of St Peters' basilica after the Easter Mass in the Vatican . Waving to his fans: Pope Francis greets the crowd from the popemobile after leading Easter Mass in the Vatican . Popular pope: Dozens of Catholics hold up their smartphones and tablets, some grasping 'selfie sticks', to get a snap of the pontiff . Holy ceremony: Pope Francis swings an incense burner as he presides over the traditional Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square . Waiting for the pope: Hundreds of worshipers wait in the rain for Pope Francis' arrival to the Easter Mass in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican . This is part of Pope Francis `Urbi et Orbi' Easter message, which he delivered Sunday: . 'We ask for peace, above all, for Syria and Iraq, that the roar of arms may cease and that peaceful relations may be restored among the various groups which make up those beloved countries. May the international community not stand by before the immense humanitarian tragedy unfolding in these countries and the drama of the numerous refugees. 'We pray for peace for all the peoples of the Holy Land. May the culture of encounter grow between Israelis and Palestinians and the peace process be resumed, in order to end years of suffering and division. 'We implore peace for Libya, that the present absurd bloodshed and all barbarous acts of violence may cease, and that all concerned for the future of the country may work to favor reconciliation and to build a fraternal society respectful of the dignity of the person. For Yemen too we express our hope for the growth of a common desire for peace, for the good of the entire people. 'At the same time, in hope we entrust to the merciful Lord the framework recently agreed to in Lausanne, that it may be a definitive step toward a more secure and fraternal world. We ask the risen Lord for the gift of peace for Nigeria, South Sudan and for the various areas of Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. May constant prayer rise up from all people of goodwill for those who lost their lives - I think in particular of the young people who were killed last Thursday at Garissa University College in Kenya -, for all who have been kidnapped, and for those forced to abandon their homes and their dear ones.","Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby hail victims of Kenya university massacre as martyrs .

lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,Summarize the following text: ,CNN-DailyMail,"The Clinton Foundation, which has been a target of criticism from Republicans, has said it will continue to accept donations from foreign governments despite the risk of a conflict of interest now that its founder is running for the White House. The charity announced on Wednesday that it has decided to continue to look abroad for millions of dollars while limiting donor nations to a select group of six. The change in policy comes as former board member Hillary Clinton undertakes her presidential campaign. The foundation's reliance on funding from several Middle East governments that suppress dissent and women's rights — concerns that the State Department focused on during her stint as secretary of state — sparked criticism and gave Republicans a new offensive against the leading Democrat. Clinton resigned from the foundation's board last week. Scroll down for video . Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, pictured on Tuesday, meets with local residents at the Jones St. Java House in LeClaire, Iowa. She resigned from the board of the Clinton foundation last week . The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation's board said on Wednesday night that future donations will only be allowed from the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom — all nations that previously supported the charity's health, poverty and climate change programs. Longtime U.S. allies, the six maintain relatively uncontroversial ties to the U.S. While direct contributions from other governments would be halted, those nations could continue participating in the Clinton Global Initiative, a subsidiary program that encourages donors to match contributions from others to tackle international problems without direct donations to the charity. Donations greater that $25million . Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation . Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada) Fred Eychaner . Frank Giustra, The Radcliffe Foundation . Nationale Postcode Loterij . The Children's Investment Fund Foundation . UNITAID . Donations $10-$25million . AUSAID . Stephen L. Bing . COPRESIDA . Tom Golisano . Government of Norway . The Hunter Foundation * . Kingdom of Saudi Arabia * . The Victor Pinchuk Foundation . Cheryl and Haim Saban & The Saban Family Foundation * . The ELMA Foundation . Theodore W. Waitt . However, the foundation will stop holding CGI meetings abroad — a final session is scheduled for Morocco in May — and most foreign governments will no longer be allowed to sponsor programs. Clinton Foundation donations between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million. In addition to the six nations that will be allowed to continue donating, the others were Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Kuwait, Italy, Brunei, Taiwan and the Dominican Republic. The foundation also will begin disclosing its donors every quarter instead of annually — an answer to long-standing criticism that the foundation's once-a-year lists made it difficult to view shifts and trends in the charity's funding. Former President Bill Clinton and other foundation officials have long defended the charity's transparency, but the new move signaled sensitivity to those concerns, particularly as his wife begins her race for the White House. Hillary Clinton's campaign referred questions about the board's action to the foundation. Last month, while she was still a board member, Clinton defended the family charity to questions about its reliance on donations from foreign governments, saying the foundation had 'hundreds of thousands of donors.' Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said that under the new disclosure policy, 'the Clinton Foundation is reinforcing its commitment to accountability while protecting programs that are improving the lives of millions of people around the world'. But he also insisted that the old annual disclosure policy went 'above and beyond what's required by voluntarily disclosing our more than 300,000 donors on our website for anyone to see'. Hillary Clinton had previously agreed with the Obama administration to limit new foreign donations to the foundation while she served as secretary of state, but at least six nations that previously contributed still donated to the charity during her four-year stint. Bill and Hillary Clinton address the audience during a Clinton Global Initiative event last September in New York. Donations to their foundation between 2001 and 2015 showed governments and agencies from 16 nations previously gave direct grants of between $55 million and $130 million . Bill Clinton in Saudi Arabia for the Global Competitiveness Forum in 2011. Saudi Arabia has been a generous donor to the Clinton Foundation - but will not be allowed to donate while Hillary makes her bid for the White House due to criticism over Middle East governments which suppress dissent and women's rights . In one case, the foundation failed to notify the State Department about a donation from the government of Algeria. Clinton Foundation officials had hinted in recent weeks that the organization was considering new limits on foreign government donations after several media accounts this year raised questions about the foundation's reliance on those practices. The foundation's board began discussions over the past two days about altering some of the charity's procedures in an effort that officials said was aimed at improving transparency without harming fundraising for critical programs. Potential problems may exist among some of the six governments that will be allowed to continue providing direct donations to the foundation. For examples, the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, which has already given the foundation between $250,000 and $500,000, has pushed for the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. The project is a domestic flashpoint in the climate change debate as well as a contentious issue regarding its impact on jobs and oil supplies. President  Obama has yet to decide whether to approve the pipeline, which would span several U.S. states, but he has already vetoed one bill aimed at swiftly approving the plan.","Future donations will only be allowed from the governments of Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom .
