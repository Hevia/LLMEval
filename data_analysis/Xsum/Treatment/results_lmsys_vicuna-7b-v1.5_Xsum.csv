Ms Farman was found dead at her home in Clydebank on February 1.
Her son, who was in the house at the time, was unharmed.
Police are treating the death as murder and are appealing for information.
Three men have been arrested and charged in connection with the killing.
The men, aged between 18 and 25, appeared at Dumbarton Sheriff Court last week.
They are due to return to court next month.
Ms Farman's parents said they had not been able to attend her funeral due to their health issues.
They thanked friends in Mauritius for helping with the arrangements.
The letter went on: ""We are confident that you will give Janice the send-off which she richly deserves.
""We feel humbled by the outpouring of love and support we have received from her friends.""
Ms Farman's parents said they had learned of her death via social media and had not received any official contact from the Mauritian authorities.
They added: ""The shock and pain of all this will haunt us all our days.
""We try to cope by remembering all the good deeds she did throughout her life. The love she shared with so many and her jovial fun loving nature. Janice has left a huge void in our lives.""
Ms Farman had moved to Mauritius in 2000 and had been working as the managing director of PECS (Mauritius) Ltd, a privately-owned group of companies providing data services.
She had recently moved to Albion, in the west of the island.

The text describes the situation on the small island of Guam, which is home to an important US airbase and about 6,000 troops, as well as 165,000 civilians. The island is a US territory, so an attack on Guam would be an attack on the US. Despite reassurances from the Guamanian authorities, many residents are concerned about the recent North Korean threat. The local media is covering the story, adding to the nervousness of the residents. The authorities believe it would take about 14 to 15 minutes for a North Korean missile to reach Guam, and the Guam Homeland Security Office has said it would put out a mass public notification via the emergency broadcasting system if there were any threat. The island has been named as a potential target for North Korean rockets before, but not everyone is fazed by the situation, with some people pointing out that such threats are not new and that people have been living with this situation for a couple of years already.","North Korea claims it has missiles capable of reaching the US mainland, but its latest threat is against Guam, a much closer target.",0.6801983714103699,860.0,0.6086956521739131,0.08187134502923976,0.14432989690721648,0.045454545454545456,0.0058823529411764705,0.010416666666666666,0.34782608695652173,0.04678362573099415,0.08247422680412371,11.5234375,8.8640625,7.5927734375,6.396484375,5.34375

The news comes after the UK government last week reiterated its commitment to the project despite the rising cost of the electricity it will produce.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the government remained committed to building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, despite the rising potential cost to the consumer of the electricity it will produce.
He said Hinkley was vital to a strong economy and still worth the cost.
The UK's National Audit Office estimated future top-up payments would rise from £6.1bn to £29.7bn over the length of the contract.
The Hinkley Point C project has been delayed for years due to concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project.
The company says it has called a board meeting for 28 July and the investment decision is on the agenda.
BBC correspondent John Moylan said the firm's board is expected to give the plant the go-ahead.
It was initially due to cost £12bn, but recent estimates put the cost at £18bn.

The Jakarta attacks on Thursday, which killed at least seven people and injured dozens more, have been condemned by Indonesian President Joko Widodo and other world leaders.
The attacks, which targeted a Starbucks, a Dunkin' Donuts, and a local market, were claimed by the Islamic State group.
The hashtag #KamiTidakTakut (#WeAreNotAfraid) has emerged in the aftermath of Thursday's attacks in Jakarta, Indonesia. A common meme featuring a peace sign with Indonesia's National Monument in the center was adapted from an image used on social media after the Paris attacks. The photograph of a satay seller continuing to work at his stall after the blasts was also circulated widely online with the message ""Fear is not in our dictionary."" The hashtag #JakartaBerani (#Jakarta is Brave) also became popular. Twitter users used the hashtag #PrayforJakarta to express their sympathy for the city. Aulia Masna, a technology blogger in Jakarta, said Twitter was a platform for people to express their thoughts and emotions, and to get information and connect with each other.

The Belfast Telegraph's front page leads with a warning by DUP minister Paul Givan that about 34,000 homes in Northern Ireland could miss out on Â£91m set aside to mitigate the effects of the ""bedroom tax"" over four years.
Mr Givan said he could not release the Â£24m pledged to help claimants this year, as legally he needed the agreement of the executive.
Inside the newspaper, former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern says he believes Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness never gelled in their joint ministerial role. He adds that from his own experience ""personalities matter in a coalition government and if there is fundamental mistrust, a breach becomes harder and harder to avoid"".
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has told The Irish News that the British and Irish governments should jointly run Northern Ireland if power-sharing collapses.
He says if an executive cannot be created after an election ""the only acceptable deal for the nationalist community is joint authority"".
The News Letter includes Mrs Foster's warning of a ""brutal"" election and the expectation by her DUP colleague Sir Jeffrey Donaldson that a prolonged period of direct rule from Westminster is likely.
""Pull Back From Abyss"" is the strong headline across two pages in the Daily Mirror, above quotes from Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire describing the political situation as ""grave"".

Thames Water said the sewer was built in 1878 and is still in use today.
The video features the Singing Sewermen and their partners in a festive lights and decorations competition.
The competition is being held in a pub in east London and the winners will be announced on New Year's Eve.
Thames Water is urging people to dispose of their cooking fat in the bin rather than down the drain.
The company said that fat is the biggest cause of blockages in its sewers and that it costs millions of pounds a year to clear them.
Thames Water said that the problem is particularly bad at Christmas time when people cook more and waste more food.
The company is also urging people to use less water and to fix any leaks in their homes.
Thames Water said that a leaky tap can waste as much water as a family of four uses in a week.

The National Audit Office (NAO) has found that the big four outsourcing companies - Serco, G4S, Atos and Capita - are making operating margins of around 5% on government contracts, which is lower than the operating margin they earn on average on all contracts. However, there are three qualifications to this: the net margin for these companies for all their work is a bit less than the average for FTSE 100 companies, there is enormous variation in the profitability of different contracts, and the story of the relationship between the private-sector providers and the government is evolving. The NAO warns the Cabinet Office that there is a limit to the financial squeeze it can put on the likes of the big four, and that it may not be too long before there will be a loss of ""innovation and investment"" which ""could pose a risk to value for money in the longer term"".",Possibly the most shocking disclosure in the National Audit Office's two reviews of how private sector companies deliver public services is how little financial information the NAO can actually demand to scrutinise.,0.5234518647193909,720.0,0.48484848484848486,0.10526315789473684,0.17297297297297298,0.1875,0.039735099337748346,0.06557377049180328,0.36363636363636365,0.07894736842105263,0.1297297297297297,9.767578125,8.78271484375,7.873046875,6.771369485294118,5.999813988095238

The BBC's Adam Easton says the election result reflects a growing sense of nationalism and Euroscepticism in Poland, which has been one of the EU's most consistent net contributors.
The text describes the results of the recent parliamentary elections in Poland. The party that won the most seats is Law and Justice (PiS), led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski. It won 24.09% of the vote and 138 seats. The party's success was due to its anti-immigrant stance and promises of higher child care benefits and tax breaks for the less well-off. The party is also close to the Roman Catholic Church and supports a ban on abortions and in-vitro fertilisation. The outgoing prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, is from the Civic Platform party, which won 235 seats but only 37.58% of the vote. Three other parties also won enough seats in parliament: a new right-wing party led by rock star Pawel Kukiz, a new pro-business party, Modern Poland, and the agrarian Polish People's Party.

The smooth transition from one pope to the next has been aided by the fact that both men are from the same generation and have a similar outlook on many issues.
They also share a deep respect for each other, which has been evident in their public statements and private correspondence.
The fact that Pope Benedict is now living a relatively quiet life in the Vatican has also helped to avoid any potential conflicts or power struggles between the two men.

Aslef, the union representing drivers, has accused ScotRail of trying to push new terms and conditions through. Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith has said that the service reductions are ""astonishing"" and that the Scottish government must answer serious questions over how service cuts and amateur industrial relations are permissible under the terms of the franchise agreement.

The move was seen as a response to demands from the Pakistani government for greater control over the video-sharing website.
The lifting of the ban comes after a deal was reportedly reached between the government and Google.
The deal is said to have included a commitment by Google to restrict access to content that violates Pakistani laws.
However, the details of the deal have not been made public.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has directed internet service providers to open access to YouTube.
The move has been welcomed by many young Pakistanis, but some activists have called for greater transparency over the deal between Google and the government.
YouTube has denied claims that the authorities can filter content.
The ban on YouTube was imposed by the Supreme Court in 2012 after the US-made film Innocence of Muslims was uploaded.
The amateur-made video was condemned in the Muslim world and sparked widespread protests for its mocking portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad.
More than a dozen people died in protests in Pakistan.
Blasphemy is a crime in Pakistan and can carry the death penalty, although such a sentence has not been carried out.
Google revealed last week that it had launched local versions of YouTube for Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The move was seen as a response to demands from the Pakistani government for greater control over the video-sharing website.

The court heard that Coshever had been banned from attending games at Roots Hall for 10 years after being involved in a confrontation with a steward in 2006.
Coshever had been warned that he could face a prison sentence if he returned to the ground.
The incident on 12 February saw Coshever enter the field of play and confront a referee.
He was arrested on the pitch and taken to Southend police station.
Coshever, who has no previous convictions, was given a 12-month community order and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
The court heard that Coshever had been to see his son play for Southend United's youth team earlier in the day and had been upset when his son was substituted.
A spokesman for Southend United said: ""We are pleased that the matter has been dealt with by the courts and that Mr Coshever has been banned from attending any matches at Roots Hall for the next five years.

The US and Cuba have agreed to restore diplomatic relations, which were severed in 1961 after Fidel Castro's communist revolution.
The move was announced by President Barack Obama, who said it was a ""step towards a more normal and productive relationship"".
The US will reopen its embassy in Havana and appoint an ambassador to Cuba for the first time in more than 50 years.
Cuba will also reopen its embassy in Washington and appoint an ambassador to the US.
The two countries have agreed to work together on issues such as counter-terrorism, drug trafficking and climate change.
However, the US embargo on Cuba remains in place and restrictions on flights to Cuba have been lifted but not fully lifted.
The US-Cuba thaw has been driven by a number of factors, including the desire to improve relations with Latin America, the need to address the issue of Cuban migrants arriving in the US, and the potential for increased trade and investment opportunities.
The US and Cuba have also agreed to hold talks on the release of US citizens imprisoned in Cuba.
The move has been welcomed by many as a positive step towards improving relations between the two countries, but it has also been met with criticism from some quarters, with some arguing that the US should not be engaging with a communist regime.",The US has appointed its first ambassador to Cuba in 55 years as relations between the countries thaw.,0.7034351229667664,1203.0,0.9444444444444444,0.0752212389380531,0.13934426229508198,0.29411764705882354,0.022222222222222223,0.04132231404958678,0.7222222222222222,0.05752212389380531,0.10655737704918034,10.453125,9.0693359375,7.458333333333333,6.159939236111111,5.5442116477272725

The NFWB said it had been working with the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure the discharge was within permitted limits.
The Niagara County Legislature voted in favor of asking New York's attorney general to investigate the incident on Thursday. The local water authority said the color was caused by residue from black carbon filters used to clean the water. The water authority says July's treatment process was necessary and the discharge was within ""permitted limits."" An inky and foul-smelling cloud of water appeared at the base of Niagara Falls on July 29, 2017. Some initially suspected an oil spill, but the Niagara Falls Water Board (NFWB) said it was caused by a ""routine"" water treatment and apologized for causing alarm to residents and tourists. In a statement, the board said the ""inky water"" was the result of a ""necessary and short-term change in the waste water treatment process"" at its plant near the city of Buffalo. Officials say the plant had the correct paperwork to release the discharge, which came from one of its five sediment filtration basins and was being flushed out over the weekend in preparation for contractors to begin upgrade work.

The government has also said it will deploy 85,000 security force members, including 47,000 police and 38,000 soldiers, to ensure the safety of the 10,500 athletes, officials, journalists and tourists expected to attend the Games.
The text is discussing the security measures being taken for the upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It mentions that a Brazilian institutional security cabinet warned of a possible jihadist attack during the Olympics, but did not provide any further details. The text also mentions that the Brazilian intelligence agency (ABIN) was not officially informed of the threat. It states that Brazilian officials and their foreign partners have been monitoring communications between suspected sympathizers of radical groups, and that the biggest worry is not a coordinated attack but a lone actor or group targeting the event.

The shooting has been widely condemned as an example of racial bias in the US.
The White House said Mr Obama's request for funds was not an admission that the federal government had failed to address the issue of police-community relations.
The president has previously called for a national conversation on race and policing.
The protests have been driven by a sense of injustice and frustration over the perceived lack of accountability for police officers who use excessive force, particularly against black men.
The protests have been peaceful but some have turned violent, with shops and cars being burned.
The president's request for funds comes after a week of nationwide protests over perceived policing injustices. The protests were sparked by the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, where police were criticized for being heavy-handed in dealing with protests. The funds requested by President Obama would be spread over three years and some of the money will go towards purchasing 50,000 body cameras for police officers as well as resources to reform law enforcement departments. The president has also unveiled a taskforce on modern policing, to be chaired by Philadelphia police commissioner Charles Ramsey. Additionally, a commission tasked with making recommendations on issues stemming from the fatal shooting has convened in Ferguson. The 16-member panel will consider changes in areas including public interaction with law enforcement and community stability. The officer who shot Brown in Ferguson, Darren Wilson, resigned from the force over the weekend. The decision not to charge Wilson days earlier triggered a nationwide debate over relations between black communities and law enforcement. The policeman said he had feared for his life, while Brown's supporters said the teenager was attempting to surrender when he was shot. Some witnesses said the 18-year-old, who was unarmed, had his hands up. The shooting has been widely condemned as an example of racial bias in the US.

The gap between men and women in life expectancy is closing, but it is still not the same for boys and girls.
The reason for the difference in life expectancy between men and women is due to a combination of factors, including lifestyle, occupational hazards, and access to healthcare.
While the gap is closing, it is still not the same for boys and girls, as boys are more likely to die in their first year of life and are more likely to take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents.","The gap between male and female life expectancy is closing and men could catch up by 2030, according to an adviser for the Office for National Statistics.",0.7668617367744446,382.0,0.5555555555555556,0.16304347826086957,0.25210084033613445,0.23076923076923078,0.06593406593406594,0.10256410256410256,0.48148148148148145,0.14130434782608695,0.2184873949579832,10.484375,8.419642857142858,7.2521484375,5.90673828125,5.074620863970588

Chigunwe pleaded guilty to four offenses of fraud and money laundering, but denied four other charges of money laundering. The Crown Prosecution Service will decide whether he should face trial. The fraud was discovered when a new chief executive took over at the charity and became suspicious after asking Chigunwe for financial information. The chief executive's wife, an accounts expert, was asked to look at the records and discovered the fraud. Chigunwe was arrested and later released on bail.

He said the government's plans were ""a distraction from the real issue of how to make the NHS sustainable in the long term"".
The government has said it wants to ensure the NHS is a national health service, not an international one.
The issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex. The NHS will treat anyone who needs emergency care, regardless of their nationality. If someone has an infectious disease, they will also be treated. Beyond that, the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, which means that if their residents need care while in the UK temporarily, they will be treated and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country. However, the NHS is not very good at collecting this money, because of a perverse incentive in the system. The government is consulting on measures to tackle this issue, including a £200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and a cost-recovery unit to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments. The government estimates that foreign visitors cost the NHS £2bn a year, but some experts say the figure is exaggerated and the government's plans are a distraction from the real issue of how to make the NHS sustainable in the long term.","Up to £500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.",0.7388414740562439,1228.0,0.5,0.03862660944206009,0.07171314741035857,0.058823529411764705,0.004310344827586207,0.008032128514056226,0.3888888888888889,0.030042918454935622,0.055776892430278883,11.203125,7.99140625,6.5810546875,5.816228693181818,5.178571428571429

The Independent's closure marks the end of an era for British journalism. It was a pioneer of the ""new journalism"" that emerged in the 1980s, which emphasized the use of narrative and human interest stories, and was characterized by a more liberal and less partisan approach than the traditional newspapers.
The Independent was set up by Stephen Glover, Andreas Whittam Smith and Matthew Symonds, who had previously worked at the Daily Telegraph.
It was launched on October 7, 1986, with a circulation of 20,000 copies. By the end of the year, it had sold 100,000 copies a day, and by 1990 it had reached a peak of 428,000 copies.
The Independent was known for its distinctive design, which featured a large front-page photograph and a smaller headline above it.
It was also famous for its ""splash"" feature, which was a long, in-depth story that filled the entire back page.
The Independent was known for its liberal and left-leaning editorial stance, and it was often criticized for being too biased.
In 2003, the Independent was sold to Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev, who had previously owned the Evening Standard.
In 2010, Alexander Lebedev's son Evgeny took over the newspaper, and in 2014 he announced that the Independent would be sold if someone ""offers the right price"".

The UK government has published a paper outlining plans for an ""ambitious new customs arrangement"" with the EU after it leaves, including a ""temporary customs union"" after March 2019 to prevent border problems. However, the Scottish First Minister has said the UK should commit to staying in the single market and customs union, period.

He was known as the ""Blade Runner"" and won gold medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Paralympics.
The appeal hearing was the latest twist in a case that has gripped South Africa and the world since Pistorius shot Ms Steenkamp dead on Valentine's Day in 2013.
The Paralympian, who was born without fibulae in his legs, shot his girlfriend through a locked toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
He claimed he mistook her for an intruder and did not mean to kill her.
The case has raised questions about the treatment of disabled people in South Africa and the country's gun laws.
Pistorius was sentenced to five years in prison, but was released after serving one year.
The appeal hearing was held to determine whether the conviction of culpable homicide should be changed to murder.
The judges did not consider the facts of the case, but rather the application of the law.
The case has been highly technical and has thrown up many twists and turns.
The appeal judges did not take new evidence, but heard arguments from both sides on whether the trial judge interpreted the law correctly.
The prosecution argued that Pistorius should have foreseen that by firing four shots through a locked door into a toilet cubicle, the person behind the door would have been killed.
Pistorius' lawyer argued that the athlete suffered from an anxiety disorder and fired in quick succession.
The final ruling is not expected for some weeks.
Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide at his trial in October last year.
Ms Steenkamp's relatives have said they think Pistorius is ""getting off lightly"".
Pistorius was released from prison on 19 October and is currently under correctional supervision.
His family said he would ""strictly"" adhere to his parole conditions at his uncle's upmarket home in Pretoria.
Pistorius competed in the 400m at the London 2012 Olympics, wearing carbon-fibre blades to run against able-bodied athletes.
He was known as the ""Blade Runner"" and won gold medals at the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 Paralympics.

The LLDC said it would continue to work with West Ham to ensure the stadium is used for a range of events, including music concerts and other sporting events.
The group said they were ""disappointed"" by the decision but had expected it.
The government said the deal had been ""scrutinised"" and ""upheld"".
The LLDC, which owns the stadium, said West Ham contributed £15m to the £272m conversion of the stadium and the development corporation would also pay for ""facilities and services"" such as pitch maintenance and for stewarding on match days, which can cost £2.5m annually.
It is also understood the club will pay up to £2.5m a year in rent, although the LLDC said it would never reveal that information.
In comparison, Manchester City, who moved into the former Commonwealth Games stadium, pay overheads on top of £4m rent.
The coalition of supporters, made up of trusts from clubs including Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, started an online petition which had gained more than 24,000 signatures in favour of a public inquiry.
Mat Roper said the group remained concerned they were expected to see it as a ""fabulous deal for the taxpayer"" when they had not seen any figures to support the claim and one document they requested had been ""completely redacted"".
He said: ""We're no nearer the truth of what we think is in the rental agreement....until we know that then we're going to continue.
""Whether it happens to be continuing with that petition, a new petition or... a new FOI request, it's certainly not dead in the water.""
The group said they remained concerned the deal would give the Hammers a competitive advantage.
But the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said: ""West Ham United has a concession at the stadium and their contributions reflect that status.
""The contract, awarded after an open public competition, has been widely scrutinised and tested in court.
""The stadium remains in public ownership and the profits from its multiple uses will flow to the taxpayer.""
While West Ham will host all of their home matches at the stadium, British Athletics will take control of the arena for one month every summer.

Ibori was jailed in the UK for fraud totalling nearly £50m in 2012.
After he was released he launched his claim against the Home Secretary Amber Rudd for damages for false imprisonment and breach of his rights.
On Monday Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb said the home secretary had been ""wrong throughout her dealings with Mr Ibori over the weeks leading to his release"" and that he had been unlawfully detained.
However, she rejected Ibori's claim for £4,000 in damages. Instead she awarded ""nominal damages"" of £1.
The judge also said that the decision to keep him in immigration detention was probably because of millions of pounds the authorities have still not recovered from him.
A Home Office email, published in the court judgement, recommended to keep him in immigration detention to buy time to work out how to recover at least £57m.
""The best course of action at present is to place him in immigration detention and review the position in February or when we know more about the confiscation process"", it said.

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates for the second time in a year, citing a stronger economic growth and rising employment. The key rate has been raised to a range of 0.5% to 0.75%. However, the Fed expects the economy to need only ""gradual"" increases in the short term. The rise is only a ""modest shift"". The new Donald Trump administration could mean rates having to rise at a faster pace next year, but it is uncertain how economic policy may change and what effect it may have on the economy. The interest rate move was widely expected and followed the last increase a year ago. Rates have been near zero since the global financial crisis, but the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices, and growth in manufacturing and services.

Lancashire's Livingstone is one of five uncapped players named in England's squad for the three-match Twenty20 series against South Africa, starting in Southampton on 21 June.
The other four uncapped players are Mason Crane, Dawid Malan, Tom Curran and Craig Overton.
Livingstone, who scored 129 from 83 balls for England Lions against South Africa A last week, is a left-handed batsman who has been in good form for Lancashire this season.
Moeen Ali, Jake Ball, Adil Rashid, Joe Root and Ben Stokes have been rested and will instead play for their respective counties in the inaugural day-night round of the County Championship, which starts on 26 June.
Sussex fast bowler Tymal Mills has been ruled out with a back injury, but Durham seamer Mark Wood returns after missing the India series through injury.
Middlesex opener Malan, Surrey paceman Curran and Somerset all-rounder Overton have previously been included in England squads, while Hampshire leg-spinner Crane is called up after impressing in the North-South series in March.
Overton will replace Wood in the squad after the first match, while wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow will be available for the first two matches before returning to Yorkshire.
Jason Roy, who has managed just 18 runs in three innings for England in the ongoing Champions Trophy, is named in the squad.
Chairman of selectors James Whitaker said: ""The squad has an exciting blend of youth and experience and we are looking forward to a competitive series against strong opposition.

The FA's verdict of no case to answer against Clattenburg was hardly a surprise, given that the alleged victim, John Obi Mikel, had not even heard the comment but was relying on second-hand evidence from Brazilian team-mate Ramires.
Clattenburg missed four weekends of Premier League matches while the FA investigated Chelsea's complaint.
The Metropolitan Police dropped its own inquiry earlier this month.
Clattenburg said it was ""truly frightening"" to have faced the prospect that his career might be over.
The evidence for Chelsea's allegation towards Clattenburg came from their midfielder Ramires, who explained that his instinctive reaction was to seek confirmation from Mikel as to what the referee said.
Mikel, who was being spoken to by Clattenburg, did not hear what it is suggested was said to him.
The two assistant referees and the fourth official revealed they did not hear any of the comments Clattenburg was accused of making, despite being linked up to the referee via microphones.
An FA statement also said the complaint by Mikel's team-mate Ramires was ""made in good faith"".
Clattenburg has always maintained his innocence and the FA's decision to charge Mikel with misconduct has been criticized by some as a ""knee-jerk reaction"".
The incident has been described as a ""storm in a teacup"" and a ""non-story"" by some, while others have praised Chelsea for taking a stand against racism in football.
The case has been criticized by some as a ""knee-jerk reaction"" and an example of the FA being too quick to judge.

The batteries are now enclosed in stainless steel boxes, which are ventilated to the outside of the plane.
Boeing says this means that in the unlikely event of any future fire or smoke, it would not affect the rest of the aircraft.
The 787 Dreamliner was grounded in January after a fire broke out in one of the planes.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has now approved the revamped battery design, allowing the planes to fly again.
Boeing has put 200,000 engineer hours into fixing the problem, with staff working round the clock.
A total of 300 Boeing engineers have been fitting new batteries and their containment systems to the aircraft in the past week.
Boeing expects to complete repairs on all 50 of the grounded Dreamliners by the middle of May.
The Dreamliner entered service in 2011 and is half made from lightweight composite materials, making it more fuel efficient than other planes of the same size.
The two lithium-ion batteries are not used when the plane is in flight, but are used to power the aircraft's brakes and lights when it is on the ground.
The batteries are now enclosed in stainless steel boxes, which are ventilated to the outside of the plane.
Boeing says this means that in the unlikely event of any future fire or smoke, it would not affect the rest of the aircraft.","An Ethiopian Airlines 787 Dreamliner has flown from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, the first commercial flight by the Boeing aircraft since all 787s were grounded in January.",0.3465059995651245,1167.0,0.5555555555555556,0.06437768240343347,0.11538461538461538,0.15384615384615385,0.017241379310344827,0.031007751937984496,0.4074074074074074,0.04721030042918455,0.08461538461538462,9.1533203125,6.502387152777778,5.055036272321429,4.251627604166667,3.4698751698369565

The airlines' decisions follow a growing global outcry against trophy hunting, which has been criticized for promoting the killing of endangered species and for being a form of ""canned hunting"" in which animals are bred for the purpose of being killed.
The text is about airlines announcing that they will no longer transport lion, rhinoceros, leopard, elephant or buffalo remains. The decision was made after an online petition and following the killing of Cecil, a major tourist attraction in Zimbabwe, by a US dentist. Delta made the announcement first and did not give official reasons for their decision. Other airlines have also announced that they will stop transporting trophy-hunting kills.

The Chinese are not just buying these clubs for the sake of it. They are buying them to promote their own interests, to sell their own products, to get their own people into positions of power.
Their long-term aim is to make China a major player in world football.
The takeover of Wolves by Fosun has seen the club's shares and assets transferred from previous owner Steve Morgan to Fosun in a deal worth £45m. Fosun, one of the largest investment groups in China, has stakes in various leisure and entertainment projects around the world and currently has interests in several UK companies including Thomas Cook. Fosun has links with super-agent Jorge Mendes, who represents Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo among others. The new-look board at Molineux will consist of four members, including Jeff Shi, who led the negotiations on behalf of Fosun and will become the club's representative, while local businessmen and Wolves supporters John Bowater and John Gough will also continue to serve as non-executive board members. Chief executive Jez Moxey will also step down after 16 years at Molineux.",Championship club Wolves have confirmed that they have been bought by Chinese conglomerate Fosun International.,0.6734766960144043,1049.0,0.4,0.030927835051546393,0.05741626794258373,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26666666666666666,0.020618556701030927,0.03827751196172249,9.88671875,7.8486328125,6.4794921875,5.45263671875,4.426225142045454

The Russian government is also considering a range of measures to support the economy, including tax breaks for businesses that invest in new equipment and infrastructure, and subsidies for low-income families.
The government is also looking at ways to boost domestic consumption, such as by increasing welfare payments and subsidies for low-income families.
The Russian government expects a 0.8% decline in GDP next year, compared with 0.6% GDP growth in 2014 as a whole. The rouble fell to a rate of 57 to the dollar on Monday, a fall of more than 6%, after some gains last week. Russia's economy, heavily reliant on energy exports, has been hit by the oil price slump and Western sanctions. The sanctions, imposed because of Russian support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, target the oil and gas industries as well as banks, arms manufacturers and the wealthy elite close to President Vladimir Putin. Russia blocked most imported Western food in retaliation for the measures. The rouble has lost half its value against the dollar this year. The Russian ministry for economic development said the manufacturing, construction, agriculture and service sectors all contracted in November. Energy, mining and the retail trade showed continued growth. President Putin signed a law on Monday doubling the deposit guarantee for bank accounts, to 1.4m roubles (Â£16,290; $25,370). The last time Russia suffered a major economic crisis, in 1998, many ordinary Russians saw their bank savings wiped out. Mr Putin has also given the Russian central bank the power to recapitalise the country's biggest retail bank, Sberbank, directly with soft loans. The total must not exceed Sberbank's capital as measured on 1 January 2015. The ""subordinated debt"" issued by the central bank, if Sberbank needs it, will not have to be repaid until other loans have been paid off. It is a cushion in case Sberbank gets into financial difficulty. Other banks can be recapitalised by the central bank through Russia's deposit guarantee agency, using federal government bonds. The Russian government is also considering a range of measures to support the economy, including tax breaks for businesses that invest in new equipment and infrastructure, and subsidies for low-income families. The government is also looking at ways to boost domestic consumption, such as by increasing welfare payments and subsidies for low-income families.","The Russian economy contracted by 0.5% in November, the first fall in national output - Gross Domestic Product - since October 2009, official figures show.",0.6145269870758057,2270.0,0.5416666666666666,0.03299492385786802,0.06220095693779904,0.08695652173913043,0.005089058524173028,0.009615384615384616,0.4166666666666667,0.025380710659898477,0.0478468899521531,10.963541666666666,7.813058035714286,6.265625,5.244140625,4.4521484375

The UK's proposal to grant EU migrants who have lived in the UK for five years a new ""UK settled status"" was unveiled by Prime Minister Theresa May at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday. The plan would affect 3.2 million EU citizens now living in the UK and would allow them to stay in the country and access health, education and other benefits. However, there are still many other questions about Brexit that need to be resolved, including the UK's divorce bill and the Northern Ireland border. The summit's final day is to focus on migration, security and economic issues, and both sides would like to get the issue of citizens' rights wrapped up as soon as possible.","German Chancellor Angela Merkel has described UK plans to ensure the rights of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit as ""a good start"".",0.6251110434532166,575.0,0.5217391304347826,0.0967741935483871,0.16326530612244897,0.045454545454545456,0.008130081300813009,0.013793103448275864,0.34782608695652173,0.06451612903225806,0.10884353741496598,9.30078125,7.267252604166667,5.818142361111111,4.83056640625,4.138802083333333

The text describes the burial of Osama Bin Laden, who was shot and killed by the US military. The burial was carried out in accordance with Islamic tradition, with religious rites performed on a US aircraft carrier. The body was then flown to Afghanistan for identification and a DNA sample was taken for confirmation of Bin Laden's identity. The body was then flown to the USS Carl Vinson, where a military officer read prepared religious remarks and the body was positioned on a flat board and eased into the Arabian Sea. The text also discusses the reasons for the sea burial, including the desire to prevent his grave from becoming a shrine and the lack of time to negotiate with other countries for a possible burial on land. Some religious scholars question the appropriateness of the sea burial and suggest that a proper burial could have been arranged with the help of the Bin Laden family or supporters of his ideology.","US officials say Osama Bin Laden's body was treated with respect and buried at sea, but some Muslims argue there was no good reason for not burying it on land.",0.8071138262748718,795.0,0.5161290322580645,0.09876543209876543,0.16580310880829016,0.2,0.037267080745341616,0.06282722513089005,0.3870967741935484,0.07407407407407407,0.1243523316062176,10.65625,8.285435267857142,6.435724431818182,5.251627604166667,4.442228618421052

The text is discussing the possibility of a ban on electronic devices on flights from the US to Europe. It mentions that most people assume the ban is coming and that it would primarily affect Heathrow Airport, which handles the most flights to the US from Europe. The text also raises concerns about the potential danger of lithium-ion batteries catching fire in the cargo hold of planes, and the difficulty of extinguishing such fires. It quotes Captain John Cox, a former pilot and member of the Royal Aeronautical Society, as saying that bunching electronic devices together in the hold is the worst possible thing that could be done, and that the best way to prevent fires is to have well-trained human beings on board the plane who can quickly react to any incidents. The text also mentions that the US Department of Homeland Security is likely to make the decision on the ban in isolation from the safety experts at the US Federal Aviation Administration, and that this has happened before with the current laptop ban on some flights from the Middle East.","Airports, airlines and the government are bracing themselves for a ban on laptops, tablets, cameras and e-readers going as hand luggage on flights between Europe and America.",0.6467902064323425,925.0,0.4642857142857143,0.07027027027027027,0.12206572769953052,0.14814814814814814,0.021739130434782608,0.037914691943127965,0.2857142857142857,0.043243243243243246,0.07511737089201878,9.11328125,7.166666666666667,6.075570913461538,5.130425347222222,4.433682528409091

The French authorities have said the Airbus A310, which crashed in the Indian Ocean in June 2009, should not have been allowed to fly. The crash killed 152 people, most of whom were French citizens visiting relatives in the Comoros. There was only one survivor, a teenage girl who was rescued from the sea. Many of the passengers had begun their journey in Paris or Marseille on another jet operated by the national airline of Yemen, before boarding flight IY626 in Sanaa. The association of the victims' families, AFVCA, has welcomed the charge, saying it is a great relief for the families of the victims who have waited four and a half years. Yemenia has previously said that bad weather was the more likely cause of the crash, but the French authorities have said the plane was not airworthy. The crash caused anger amongst the Comorian community in France as people complained that the aircraft had been in poor condition. The plane was banned from French airspace after inspectors found numerous faults in 2007, according to the then transport minister, Dominique Bussereau. Several European countries had also found a number of problems when they inspected Yemenia aircraft prior to the crash. Officials from Yemen have previously said the plane had undergone a thorough inspection and conformed to international standards.","France has charged Yemenia Airways with manslaughter over a 2009 crash off the Comoros Islands that killed 152 people, judicial sources say.",0.6721683740615845,1214.0,0.6363636363636364,0.0639269406392694,0.11618257261410789,0.14285714285714285,0.013761467889908258,0.02510460251046025,0.2727272727272727,0.0273972602739726,0.04979253112033195,9.046875,7.56640625,5.75341796875,4.5372314453125,3.73280029296875

Volkswagen shares plunged more than 18% on Monday after US regulators found that some of its cars could manipulate official emissions tests. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that software in several diesel cars could deceive regulators. Volkswagen was ordered to recall half a million cars in the US on Friday. In addition to paying for the recall, VW faces fines that could add up to billions of dollars. There may also be criminal charges for VW executives. The White House in Washington also reportedly said it was ""quite concerned"" about VW's conduct. Volkswagen's chief executive apologised after the scandal emerged. The EPA found the ""defeat device"" in diesel cars including the Audi A3 and the VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has stopped selling the relevant diesel models in the US, where diesel cars account for about a quarter of sales. The EPA said that the fine for each vehicle that did not comply with federal clean air rules would be up to $37,500 (£24,000). With 482,000 cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations, it means the fines could reach $18bn. That would be a considerable amount, even for the company that recently overtook Toyota to be the world's top-selling vehicle maker in the first six months of the year.

England have qualified for the Euro 2016 tournament in France with a perfect record of six wins from six games in Group E. The team's performance in the group stage was described as ""The Group of Death"" only because of its reputation for being difficult to navigate, but in reality, it was not a particularly challenging group. England's qualification campaign was efficient if not spectacular, and the team's performance in the group was not particularly impressive.

The US president-elect's call with Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, on 10 December was the first direct contact between leaders of the two sides since 1979.
It was a move that surprised many in the region and prompted an immediate response from Beijing, which warned that it would ""not sit idly by"" if the US continued to support Taiwan.
The call came just days after Mr Trump's victory in the US presidential election, and it was seen as a test of his willingness to challenge China on the issue of Taiwan.
The US has a long-standing ""One China"" policy, which recognizes Beijing's claim to Taiwan but does not formally acknowledge Taiwan as a separate country.
The policy is based on the idea that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is part of it.
However, the US has informal ties with Taiwan, including military and economic links.
The ""One China"" policy is a sensitive issue for China, which sees Taiwan as a breakaway province that must eventually be reunited with the mainland.
China has threatened to use force to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, and has repeatedly urged the US to abandon its ties with Taiwan and recognize Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China.
The US has traditionally been careful to avoid taking actions that could be seen as challenging China's claim to Taiwan, but there have been some exceptions.
In 1996, for example, the US Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which established a framework for maintaining unofficial ties with Taiwan.
The act was seen as a response to China's threat to use force to reunify Taiwan with the mainland.
The US has also sold arms to Taiwan in the past, despite China's objections.
The ""One China"" policy is a key part of China's foreign policy, and any suggestion that it might be changing has been met with strong condemnation from Beijing.

King's consortium, which includes Murray and Gilligan, has pledged to invest in the club and help it return to the top flight of Scottish football.
The new board has also promised to engage with fans and other stakeholders in the future.
King was elected to the board after receiving about 85% of the votes cast at the EGM.
Derek Llambias and finance director Barry Leach were voted off the board by shareholders.
The new board has already appointed shareholder Douglas Park as a director.
David Somers, who was chairman, and James Easdale had already resigned from the board before the EGM.
King addressed fans after being voted on to the board and said the EGM was a ""turning point in the future of the club"".
He said the club is broken and everything needs to be looked at.
He also said the fans' groups have been ""absolutely superb"" and that the consortium wants to work with fans in terms of getting representation on the board.
Murray said the consortium will take time to build the board out and that appointing a first-team manager is a crucial decision.
Llambias and Leach are associates of Sports Direct and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, who was fined £7,500 by the Scottish Football Association for breaching rules on dual ownership.
King was confident ahead of the vote that he had enough votes for a simple majority to have the five resolutions passed.

Lewis Hamilton is drawing inspiration from Muhammad Ali's ""rope-a-dope"" victory over George Foreman in 1974 as he seeks to close the 29-point gap to the German driver Nico Rosberg ahead of Sunday's British Grand Prix.
Hamilton, who has finished second to Rosberg in two of the last three races, hopes to emulate Ali's success by waiting for the right time to turn the race around.
Mercedes, who have won seven of the eight races so far this season, are expected to be the strongest team at Silverstone, with Hamilton and Rosberg fighting it out at the front.

The council leader, Roger Stone, said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by the decision and that it was ""not in the best interests of the children"".
He added: ""I have asked for an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding this case to establish what happened and to ensure that this does not happen again.""
The council's deputy leader, Dominic Beck, said he had ""no idea"" how the decision was made and that he was ""shocked and appalled"" by it.
He added: ""I have asked for an immediate investigation into the circumstances surrounding this case to establish what happened and to ensure that this does not happen again.""
The council's strategic director of children and young people's services, Joyce Thacker, earlier defended the decision, saying it was influenced by UKIP's immigration policy.
She said: ""I have legal advice I have to follow for the placement of children and I was criticised before for not making sure their cultural and ethnic needs were met.
""If the party mantra is, for example, ending the active promotion of multiculturalism I have to think about that... I have to think of their longer-term needs.""
Ms Thacker added she did not think UKIP was a racist party, but said it had ""very clear"" immigration policies which she could not ignore.
The children - who are European migrants - were removed by social workers who accused the unnamed couple of belonging to a ""racist party"".
The education secretary said the ""wrong decision"" was made ""in the wrong way for the wrong reasons"".
The investigation announced by the government and the council inquiry will seek to establish the circumstances of this particular case.
But, politically, it will be interesting to see whether it has any bearing on political campaigning in the run up to Thursday's Parliamentary by-election in Rotherham.
The unnamed couple in their late 50s, who have been approved foster parents for seven years, were eight weeks into the placement when they were approached by social workers about their membership of the party.
The wife told the BBC she believed the decision had been taken ""prior to the social worker visiting us in person to tell us that the children were being removed because we were UKIP members"".
The couple first knew there were problems around their continued fostering on 14 November.
The wife said they had been meeting the cultural needs of the three children, who are European migrants.
""We were actively encouraging these children to speak their own language... we enjoyed singing one of their folk songs in their native language.
""Having been told of the religious denomination of these children - we took steps to ensure that a school of their denomination was found.
""The children have now been placed with families who are white British, therefore how are these people going to meet the cultural needs of the children?"" she added.
UKIP's immigration policy states the party wants an ""end [to] the active promotion of the doctrine of multiculturalism by local and national government"", and urges Britain to leave the European Union (EU).
The party's leader, Nigel Farage, said he was ""very upset and very angry"" about the decision and called for ""heads to roll"" at the council.
He accused the Labour-controlled council of bigotry towards his party.
Earlier, Labour leader Ed Miliband called for the council to urgently investigate the circumstances of the case.
He insisted: ""Being a member of UKIP should not be a bar to adopting or fostering children.
""We need to find out the facts and the council urgently needs to get to the bottom of exactly what happened.
""There are thousands of children who need to be looked after, who need fostering, we shouldn't have the situation where membership of a party like UKIP excludes you from doing that.""
Robert Tapsfield, chief executive of the Fostering Network, said the decision seemed ""very strange"" considering the council viewed the couple as providing a good standard of care.
He said the placement of foster children should not be influenced by their political affiliations.
The council leader, Roger Stone, said he was ""shocked and appalled"" by the decision and that it was ""not in the best interests of the children"".

The text describes how Iran has denied deploying combat troops in Syria, but reports suggest that hundreds of Iranian troops have arrived in Syria in preparation for an imminent assault on rebel-held areas. The text also mentions the deaths of four high-ranking IRGC officers in Syria, including Brig Gen Hossein Hamedani, who was the most senior Iranian military officer to have been killed in the Syrian conflict. The text suggests that Iran may be more involved in the war than it has previously acknowledged, and that Iranian and Syrian media outlets have even published photos of Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani purportedly taken in Syria. The text also mentions that IRGC officials say that their most significant contribution to the defense of President Bashar al-Assad has been the creation of the paramilitary National Defense Forces, and that Iran has trained and organized 70,000 Syrians into 128 NDF battalions. The text also notes that it is not clear how many Iranians have traveled to Syria to fight, but that Iranian media do sometimes issue casualty reports, and that a senior politician has stated that Iran is prepared to join the war.",The new offensive launched by Syrian government forces in the countryside south of Aleppo has shed light on Iran's growing role in Syria's civil war.,0.5663613080978394,1020.0,0.4444444444444444,0.06217616580310881,0.10909090909090909,0.07692307692307693,0.010416666666666666,0.018348623853211007,0.3333333333333333,0.046632124352331605,0.08181818181818182,9.91015625,7.632254464285714,6.129794034090909,5.144461495535714,4.214518229166667

The interactive map above shows the areas where turnout increased the most.
In London, turnout was 56.8%, up from 52.4% in 2012.
The SNP's dominance in Scotland was reflected in the fact that it won 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs, up six on its 2011 result.
The Conservatives became the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament, winning 31 seats.
Labour won 24 seats, the Greens six (all from the regional lists), and the Lib Dems five.
The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP.
The SNP dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies.
The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too.
The Scottish Greens won all of their seats through the regional list system and not through the constituency vote.
The Lib Dems lost their deposit in 48 constituencies.
The biggest shift in Welsh politics was the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats.
UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, but the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third.
In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most.
The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent.
A total of 124 councils were up for re-election, in part or in whole.
After all the results were counted Labour lost 18 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, and gained control of Bristol.
The Conservatives lost a total of 48 council seats.
The Lib Dems gained 45 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control.
UKIP gained 25 more council seats - but was not able to convert these gains into control of any council.
At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour.
It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.
In general, turnout was significantly lower in Wales, but it was highest at 56.8% in Cardiff North where Labour won with about 45% of the vote and Brecon and Radnorshire where the Lib Dems took more than half of the vote.
The biggest increase in turnout in Wales was in the Rhondda, the only constituency seat that changed hands.","What impact have the elections had on the political maps of London, Scotland, Wales and England?",0.4990195631980896,2798.0,0.8125,0.025440313111545987,0.04933586337760911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5625,0.01761252446183953,0.03415559772296015,11.7578125,10.302083333333334,8.89453125,7.615792410714286,6.570203993055555

The third and final debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is taking place in Las Vegas. Trump has not shown much interest in preparing for the debate, while Clinton has disappeared from the public eye to prepare. Trump has invited two guests to the debate, including Malik Obama, the half-brother of President Barack Obama, and Pat Smith, the mother of a US officer who was killed in the Benghazi attack in 2012. Polling suggests that voters are finding the campaign increasingly fractious and may see a decline in turnout on November 8th.

The decision has been criticized by the model's lawyer, who plans to challenge it in court. The lawyer argues that the first lady should not have been given special treatment as she was in South Africa on private business. The first lady is accused of assaulting the model with an extension cord at a Johannesburg hotel. The model has alleged that the first lady hit her with the cord and that she was offered money to drop the case.

Liverpool are also considering offers for midfielder Joe Allen, who has been linked with a move to Stoke City, and striker Christian Benteke, who has been linked with a move to Crystal Palace.
The Reds are looking to raise funds to help finance their summer spending spree, which is expected to include a move for Brazil midfielder Philippe Coutinho.
Liverpool are also interested in signing a new goalkeeper, with Stoke's Jack Butland and Southampton's Fraser Forster among the players being considered.
The Reds are also monitoring the situation of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who has been linked with a move to AC Milan.
Liverpool are in talks with Sevilla over a potential deal for Moreno, who is also wanted by former club Sevilla in La Liga, while Serie A giants AC Milan and Inter Milan have expressed an interest in the left-back.
Liverpool will insist on £30m for France defender Mamadou Sakho, who had a spell at Crystal Palace last term.
And winger Lazar Markovic is a target for Watford and Zenit St Petersburg.
Moreno was displaced at left-back by James Milner last season but Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is in no hurry to sell the player, although Moreno may also want more first-team football at this stage of his career.
The Anfield club are confident they will get their full asking price for Sakho, 27, given the current market for centre-backs and the player's successful loan spell at Premier League rivals Palace last season.
Serbia winger Markovic is another player unlikely to be in Klopp's plans, especially following the addition of £34m forward Mohamed Salah from Roma.
New Watford manager Marco Silva may make a move for the 23-year-old, who joined Liverpool from Benfica in a £20m deal three years ago, after being impressed with Markovic during a loan spell at Hull City last season.
Russian side Zenit have also shown an interest in Markovic, who has had loan spells at Fenerbahce and Sporting Lisbon.

The CTS is a special forces unit that has been leading the fight against IS in Iraq.
The BBC's Ian Pannell said the jihadists were putting up a hard fight.
The team also spoke to residents who had fled the area, including a family who had been living in a hole in the ground for three months.
The Iraqi government has been criticized for its handling of the Mosul operation, with some accusing it of not doing enough to protect civilians.
The UN has said that up to 100,000 people may have been displaced by the fighting so far.
The team also saw evidence of IS using human shields, with residents being forced to stay in their homes to prevent them from being targeted.
The Iraqi government has denied using human shields.
The team also spoke to a doctor who said that the situation in the city was ""catastrophic"" and that there was a lack of medical supplies and staff.
The team was also able to speak to a resident who had managed to escape from the city and was able to provide a first-hand account of the situation inside Mosul.
The resident described the city as being ""completely destroyed"" and said that there was no food, water or electricity.

The EU is drawing up plans to share the burden of refugees more evenly among member states, scrapping the rule that means they must claim asylum in the first country they arrive in.
The UK's membership of the EU is expected to dominate a meeting of the bloc's 28 leaders on February 18-19, but the migration crisis is also likely to be high on the agenda.
The Commission fears the passport-free Schengen area could collapse if a solution is not worked out by March.
Austria has become a major transit country for migrants seeking to claim asylum in Germany.
The influx has contributed to the popularity of the far right in Austria, sparking tensions in the governing coalition.
""We can't take in all asylum-seekers in Austria,"" Chancellor Faymann said after a national asylum summit in Vienna.
""We must also step up controls at our borders massively,"" he added.
In Belgrade, Labour Minister Aleksandar Vulin, the government's coordinator on the migrant crisis, said: ""From today, based on the decision of the Austrian government... migrants will not be able to continue their travel if they have not expressed intention to seek asylum on the territory of Austria or Germany.""

The US president also raised concerns about cybersecurity, saying that the US would take action against any country that engaged in cyber economic espionage.
The text describes a joint news conference at the White House between President Obama and President Xi of China, where they agreed not to engage in cyber economic espionage and to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The deal covers the theft of trade secrets but not national security information. President Obama stated that any escalation in China's alleged cybercrimes against the US would prompt sanctions, and that the US would apply ""whatever other tools"" it has in its toolkit to go after cybercriminals.

Rajapaksa has denied any wrongdoing, but the charges filed against him by a special anti-corruption commission have raised questions about his conduct while he was defence secretary.

Mr Rajan's comments come as the world's major central banks prepare to meet in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to discuss monetary policy.
The text is about Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan's warning that using cheap money to tackle economic problems may do more harm than good. He also said that central banks may not have the tools to address all economic problems and that more intervention by central banks could risk doing more harm than good. Mr Rajan acknowledged that his situation was not typical in the current climate because India still has high inflation and interest rates are high despite having been cut three times this year to try and stimulate growth. He added that some other countries have problems that are beyond what the central bank is capable of addressing and that if the other tools aren't being used, the central bank may end up creating more harm than good.

The text is discussing the ban on whitening creams in Africa. The creams are popular among young women and men in Africa who believe they make them more beautiful. However, medical experts say that these creams may cause cancer, diabetes, severe skin conditions, and other diseases. The member of Ivory Coast's pharmaceutical authority, Christian Doudouko, says that the number of people with side-effects caused by these medicines is really high. The major concern is over unregulated products, which may contain ingredients such as mercury or excessive amounts of steroids. The creams can cause a variety of health issues, such as acne, thinning of the skin, glaucoma or cataracts if applied near the eyes, or high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis, weight gain, and mood disturbance due to the absorption of large amounts of steroids. However, analysts say that the ban may not stop people from buying the products.

Townshend's lawyer, David Jeremy QC, said his client had been ""consumed by a passion for aviation"" and had not intended to cause any harm.
The incident happened on a flight from RAF Brize Norton to Afghanistan on February 9, 2014. The autopilot was deactivated when the pilot's camera was pushed into the control stick, causing the aircraft to plummet 4,400ft. The incident led to the grounding of the military fleet of six Voyager aircraft for 13 days and service personnel being stranded in Afghanistan.

The revised figures suggest the economy may have narrowly avoided falling into recession for a second time.
The construction industry shrank by 5% in the first quarter of 2012, less than previously thought.
The ONS is due to give official confirmation of this in June.
The economy needs to register two consecutive quarters of negative growth to be in recession.
The construction sector's weakness has been blamed for dragging down economic growth.
Construction accounts for less than 7% of the UK economy, whereas the services sector makes up about three quarters of output.
The ONS figures showed that construction output fell again in the first three months of this year, reaching its lowest level in 15 years.
It was down 2.4% compared the last quarter of 2012.
Output has fallen by nearly a fifth since the height of the construction boom in 2008.

Potential donors fill out a consent form and have their cheeks swabbed. Their details are then stored anonymously on an international bone marrow registry until they are 61-years-old.

""It's a bit of fun, but it's also a way of promoting cycling and the Tour de France coming to Cambridge,"" he added.
The text is about a man named Rad Wagon who is recruiting people to knit miniature ""Tour jerseys"" and wool-covered bicycle wheels for the Tour de France race that is coming to Cambridge. Schools and knitting groups have already offered to start knitting, and the council was interested. A similar idea is being promoted by Harrogate Borough Council for the Yorkshire stage of the race. The public response to that was so overwhelming the council had to ask people not to send any more knitting to them. Mr Wagon thinks knitting is in Cambridge's DNA and he wants to show that Cambridge can do things differently and perhaps oddly. A knitting shop owner has offered to give knitting lessons and collect the tiny pullovers, and a cycle shop in the city has offered a collection of battered wheels which Mr Wagon hopes can also be turned into knitted decorations. He is discussing suitable places his knitted bunting might go with the city council, and he is hoping to get permission to put it up in some of the city's historic buildings.","A man who admits he ""cannot knit a stitch"" is hoping to cover the streets of Cambridge with knitted bunting and wool artwork during the Tour de France.",0.6221187114715576,1113.0,0.7857142857142857,0.09606986899563319,0.17120622568093385,0.2962962962962963,0.03508771929824561,0.06274509803921569,0.4642857142857143,0.056768558951965066,0.10116731517509726,10.775390625,8.94775390625,7.921875,7.001220703125,6.19541015625

The text describes how the world oil prices have halved since June 2014, due to weak demand and surging US production, and how Opec's decision not to cut production has contributed to this. The text also highlights the winners and losers in this situation, including Russia, which is heavily dependent on energy revenues and has seen its currency fall as a result of the oil price drop, and Venezuela, which is struggling with economic mismanagement and high inflation. The text also notes that Saudi Arabia, the largest oil exporter and Opec's most influential member, could support global oil prices by cutting back its own production, but it has not done so yet.","Global oil prices have fallen sharply over the past seven months, leading to significant revenue shortfalls in many energy exporting nations, while consumers in many importing countries are likely to have to pay less to heat their homes or drive their cars.",0.6614749431610107,513.0,0.2857142857142857,0.10526315789473684,0.15384615384615385,0.07317073170731707,0.02654867256637168,0.03896103896103896,0.16666666666666666,0.06140350877192982,0.08974358974358974,7.5234375,6.230078125,5.502994791666667,4.775,4.242734375

Responsible Travel, a Brighton-based company, has dropped about half a dozen tours that involve zoos from its roster of 3,500 possible trips. The decision was made by the company's boss, Justin Francis, after watching a BBC TV programme about the ethics of keeping animals in zoos. Francis argues that most animals kept in zoos are not endangered and that there have been few examples of endangered species being reintroduced to the wild after being kept or bred in captivity. The travel company will still sell holidays that include trips to rescue centers, animal rehabilitation centers, and breeding centers for endangered species. The decision was welcomed by the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife charity.","A leading marketer of ""responsible tourism"" has decided to stop selling tours that include visits to zoos.",0.6164578795433044,622.0,0.6470588235294118,0.09482758620689655,0.16541353383458646,0.125,0.017391304347826087,0.030534351145038167,0.4117647058823529,0.0603448275862069,0.10526315789473684,10.46875,8.4296875,7.26513671875,6.3814453125,5.4325420673076925

The judge in the case has ordered a psychological evaluation of Mr Nassar to determine if he is fit to stand trial.
The evaluation is expected to take several days.

The text is discussing the increase in cancer diagnoses in Wales between 2006 and 2015. The main reason for the increase is attributed to the aging population. However, there has been a decrease in smoking rates, which has led to a decrease in lung cancer rates among men. On the other hand, lung cancer rates among women have increased. The most common types of cancer remain breast, prostate, lung, and bowel cancer. The rates of stomach cancer and prostate cancer decreased, while mesothelioma rates increased by almost a third. The text also notes that up to four in 10 of cancers in the population may be preventable.",The number of cancer cases in Wales has risen by almost 10% over a 10-year period.,0.7074634432792664,555.0,0.5882352941176471,0.09345794392523364,0.16129032258064516,0.1875,0.02830188679245283,0.049180327868852465,0.5294117647058824,0.08411214953271028,0.14516129032258063,9.9765625,7.7453125,6.534598214285714,5.24677734375,4.563151041666667

Workie is a cartoon character who will appear in a TV advertising campaign to promote the importance of workplace pensions. The campaign is set to begin on Wednesday evening. Since 2012, 5.4 million workers have been signed up to a workplace pension under the auto-enrolment program. However, millions more people who work for small businesses or individuals have yet to be offered a pension plan. All employers are being warned that they need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than Â£10,000 a year. This includes nannies, care workers, plumbers, and bar staff. The pensions minister, Baroness Altmann, was said to be personally involved in designing Workie. A spokesperson for The Pensions Regulator stated that Workie is the embodiment of something that cannot be ignored.",A ten foot tall hairy monster - reminiscent of Sweetums in The Muppets - is to be used to persuade more employers to set up a pension scheme.,0.3517962396144867,704.0,0.5769230769230769,0.10948905109489052,0.18404907975460125,0.08,0.014705882352941176,0.02484472049689441,0.4230769230769231,0.08029197080291971,0.13496932515337423,9.326171875,8.3828125,7.593424479166667,6.769287109375,5.9490234375

The move has been widely criticized, with protests taking place across the US over the weekend.

The Catalan government has said it would seek to negotiate a new relationship with Spain, including a new constitution, before pursuing independence.
But the secessionists are not backing down, despite the risks.
The Catalan regional parliament has voted to start the secession process, but Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has gone to the Constitutional Court to suspend the resolution. Secession is banned under Spain's constitution and the prime minister has accused campaigners of trying to ""liquidate"" the nation. The Catalan nationalists held an unofficial poll in November 2014, which showed 80% support for independence. The vote was non-binding, but the secessionists viewed it as a defining moment and declared regional elections in September 2015 would be a de facto referendum on independence. The Catalan nationalist parties won an absolute majority in the 135-seat regional assembly and on 9 November pushed through a motion to start the process towards independence. The Spanish government has hit back, declaring the secessionist step unconstitutional. The votes suggest they have popular support, but last November's non-binding poll was based on relatively low turnout of 2.2 million voters out of a potential 5.4 million. And the Junts pel Si (Together for Yes) coalition of two major separatist parties which won this year's regional election relied on the support of a radical left-wing party, CUP, to secure its majority in the Catalan parliament. Even then, they fell short of a majority of voters, with 48% support. The secessionists control the regional parliament but Catalan opinion on secession appears evenly divided. With Spain facing a general election on 20 December, and no party expected to win a clear majority nationally, the Catalan issue is only adding to political uncertainty.","Pro-independence parties in Spain's richest region, Catalonia, are pushing ahead with a historic plan for an independent state within 18 months, and the national government in Madrid is fighting back.",0.5496727824211121,1635.0,0.625,0.06920415224913495,0.12461059190031154,0.0967741935483871,0.010416666666666666,0.018808777429467082,0.34375,0.03806228373702422,0.06853582554517133,8.8486328125,6.912760416666667,6.009465144230769,5.1259765625,4.588512073863637

Spain's interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said the country was ""on high alert"" and that the authorities were working to ""neutralise the threat"".
The Barcelona attack was the deadliest in Spain since the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800 others.
The attack was carried out by a group of at least eight militants, who used a van to drive through a pedestrian zone, killing 13 people and injuring more than 100 others. The attack was claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, but there is no confirmed link to the group yet.
Five suspects were shot dead by police in the town of Cambrils, 120km south of Barcelona, after they attacked several people with knives. Another suspect was arrested in Alcanar, a town near Barcelona.
The driver of the van is still on the run, but police have arrested four suspects - three Moroccans and a Spaniard from the North African enclave of Melilla. One of the Moroccans, Driss Oukabir, is believed to have rented the van using his brother Moussa's name.
Spain has intensified its security cooperation with Morocco in recent years, and there is believed to be a Moroccan connection in the Barcelona case.

The American Health Care Act aimed to replace Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, which is commonly known as Obamacare.
The bill was withdrawn after it became clear it would not get the minimum of 215 Republican votes needed.
The withdrawal of the bill was a huge blow to Mr Trump, who had made repealing and replacing Obamacare a key part of his election campaign.
The bill faced opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans, who had different concerns about the legislation.
Some conservatives felt the bill did not go far enough in cutting healthcare spending, while others believed it did not do enough to roll back Obamacare.
The bill was also unpopular with the public, with just 17% approving of it in a recent poll.
Despite the setback, Mr Trump said he would continue to push for a healthcare overhaul and predicted that Obamacare would ""explode"".
He blamed the Democrats for not supporting the bill and suggested that the Republicans would now focus on tax reform.

The Scottish National Party (SNP) won the most seats in last week's local elections, taking 431 out of a total of 793. The Conservatives finished second overall on 25%, with Labour on 20%. The SNP's share of the vote was unchanged from 2012, with the Conservatives increasing by 12 percentage points. Overall turnout was 46.9%, higher than the 39.6% recorded in 2012. The highest turnout was in East Renfrewshire at 57.8%, while Glasgow recorded the lowest at 39%. The SNP secured 610,454 first preference votes in last Thursday's election - an increase from the 503,233 it won in 2012. However, the higher turnout this time around meant the party's share of the vote was 32.3% in both elections. The SNP also won 431 seats, finishing as the biggest party in 16 of the 32 council areas and joint largest in a further three, although it lost its overall majorities in Dundee and Angus. Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservatives won 276 seats - 22.5% of the total - after receiving 478,073 first preference votes. In 2012 the Tories won just 115 seats and received 206,599 votes - a 13.3% share. The Conservatives finished as the largest party on six councils, and were joint largest alongside the SNP in Stirling. Scottish Labour saw its share of the first preference votes fall from 31.4% to 20.2% and its number of seats from 394 to 262. Labour also lost overall control of all four councils where it previously had a majority - including Glasgow - and is now the largest party in just three local authority areas and joint biggest in a further one. Despite the higher turnout, the party received 100,000 fewer first preference votes than in 2012, dropping from 488,703 to 380,957. The Scottish Liberal Democrats received a 6.8% share of the first preference votes as they won 67 seats, with the Scottish Greens winning 19 seats on 4.1% of the votes. Almost 200,000 people - 10% of the total - gave their first preference votes to independent candidates, who won 168 seats across the country.

The price of gas has fallen by 15% in the last year, while the price of electricity has dropped by 10%.
Ofgem said the fall in wholesale costs should be reflected in lower bills for consumers, but the big six energy suppliers have so far refused to pass on the full benefit to customers.
Nolan said: ""We expect the big six to pass on the full benefit of these lower wholesale costs to consumers.""
The regulator has warned that if the big six do not cut their prices, it will take action to protect consumers.
Nolan said that the regulator would consider a range of measures, including imposing price controls or fines, if the big six failed to reduce their prices.
He added that the regulator would also look at ways to encourage consumers to switch suppliers, such as making it easier to compare prices and switching tariffs.

The family of Rashan Charles, who died in police custody, has called for peaceful protests and urged people not to use his death as an excuse to commit crime.
The 20-year-old was pursued by police in Dalston, east London, on July 22 and became ill after trying to swallow an object. He died in hospital soon after.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating his death, and the Met Police has said it is cooperating fully with the investigation.
Clashes broke out in Hackney on Friday as protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight.
The family's spokesman, Stafford Scott, said: ""Burning down homes will not give justice. Taking it to the streets doesn't give you justice.""
He added that the family was seeking the best legal support and urged the community to support them in their struggle for justice.
Diane Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, told the protest that she supported the family and would not rest until questions were answered.

The protests have been seen as a reflection of growing intolerance in India, with writers and intellectuals facing increasing attacks and threats.
The Sahitya Akademi has been criticised for not speaking out against the attacks on writers and intellectuals, and for not taking measures to protect freedom of speech.

The study's authors said their findings showed the value of early paternal involvement. They said the signs of a father's impact on a child's cognitive development could be seen from as early as three months. The study found a positive correlation between the degree to which fathers engaged with their babies at three months and how those children went on to score in cognitive tests at the age of two. The positive link between involved fathers and higher test scores was seen equally whether the child was a boy or a girl. However, children whose fathers displayed more withdrawn and depressive behaviours in father-infant interactions scored lower marks in the cognitive tests. The study, published in the Infant Mental Health Journal, concluded that remote fathers use fewer verbal and nonverbal strategies to communicate with their infants, thereby reducing the infant's social learning experience. More withdrawn fathers also may provide a less stimulating social environment, which may thus impact the child's cognitive skills. Research lead Professor Paul Ramchandani, from Imperial, said: ""Even as early as three months, these father-child interactions can positively predict cognitive development almost two years later, so there's something probably quite meaningful for later development, and that really hasn't been shown much before."" Dr Vaheshta Sethna from King's College London added: ""We also found that children interacting with sensitive, calm and less anxious fathers during a book session at the age of two showed better cognitive development, including attention, problem-solving, language and social skills. This suggests that reading activities and educational references may support cognitive and learning development in these children."" Dr Sethna added: ""Our findings highlight the importance of supporting fathers to interact more positively with their children in early infancy."" The study comes after research by Oxford University found confident fathers, who embraced becoming a parent, were less likely to have children who displayed behavioural issues before the teenage years. This research stressed the importance of a man's attitude to fatherhood soon after birth.","Babies learn faster if their fathers engage with them in the first few months of life, a study suggests.",0.6484981179237366,2099.0,0.6842105263157895,0.03823529411764706,0.07242339832869082,0.16666666666666666,0.008849557522123894,0.016806722689075633,0.5263157894736842,0.029411764705882353,0.055710306406685235,9.599609375,7.4072265625,6.018136160714286,5.347873263888889,4.3394775390625

The Chilean flag is widely available as an emoji, while the Texas flag is not yet. The Chilean flag resembles that of the Lone Star state, and a resolution was introduced in Texas to reject the use of the Chilean flag emoji in digital forums when referring to the Lone Star Flag of Texas. Some Texans have developed a habit of using the Chilean flag emoji in text messages and on social media as a sign of national pride. The resolution is non-binding and cannot pass into law, but it aims to raise awareness about the mix-up in a light-hearted manner. The Chilean flag is a fine design, but it is not the Texas flag, and the wording of the bill emphasises the significance behind the flags' differences. Chile and its national symbols have been the subject of mix-ups before, including at the 2016 Copa America football tournament and the following day's Chile vs Argentina match.",A member of Texas' House of Representatives has filed a resolution to urge Texans to stop using an emoji representing the Chilean flag when they really mean to use the Texan flag.,0.7461360096931458,735.0,0.625,0.12422360248447205,0.20725388601036268,0.1935483870967742,0.0375,0.06282722513089005,0.4375,0.08695652173913043,0.1450777202072539,10.798828125,8.89501953125,7.623372395833333,6.6063232421875,5.622216796875

""The government is committed to ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs available in the country and will take necessary steps to regulate online sale of drugs.""
The All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD) has called for a nationwide strike to protest against the sale of drugs online.
The AIOCD claims that online drug retailers are putting customers at risk by failing to follow existing rules.
The government says it is in the process of drawing up guidelines to regulate online drug sales.
A number of companies are selling drugs online to tap a market which is estimated to be worth $10bn (Â£65m).
The strike will affect approximately 800,000 chemists across India.
The AIOCD has accused online drug retailers of selling banned and controlled substances, including anti-pregnancy pills, sleeping pills, and steroids.
The AIOCD wants the government to close down all illegal online pharma companies immediately.

The conference will also be an opportunity for the party to showcase its policies and ideas, and to try to unify the party around a common agenda.
However, the conference is also a time when the media is able to scrutinize the party's leadership and policies, and any gaffes or mistakes can have a significant impact on the party's reputation.
Therefore, it is important for the party to avoid any mishaps or embarrassments, and to present a united front to the media and the public.

The Colombian government and the Farc rebels have been holding peace talks in Havana since November 2012.
The talks have focused on issues such as land reform, political participation, illegal drugs and now transitional justice.
The two sides have reached agreements on these issues, but none of them will come into force until both sides put their signatures to the final agreement.
The conflict in Colombia has resulted in an estimated 220,000 deaths and the displacement of more than five million people.
About 8,000 left-wing Farc rebels continue to fight.
Rev Harold Good and Fr Alec Reid were independent witnesses who oversaw the decommissioning of IRA weapons, which was a vital part of the peace process in Northern Ireland.
Mark Durkan, the SDLP's representative, has said he is ""delighted to share any insights or experiences I have had that could in any way help efforts to achieve peace in Colombia.""",A delegation from Northern Ireland is travelling to Cuba  to provide support for peace talks between the Colombian government and the Farc rebel group.,0.6016381978988647,796.0,0.625,0.09740259740259741,0.16853932584269662,0.34782608695652173,0.05228758169934641,0.09090909090909091,0.2916666666666667,0.045454545454545456,0.07865168539325842,10.1640625,8.863932291666666,7.942708333333333,6.873860677083333,5.6944580078125

The judge in the case, Lord Justice Hickinbottom, said the case had been ""wholly without merit"" and that the SFO had ""over-reached itself"".
The SFO said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and was considering an appeal.
The case centred on an accusation that the men had been planning to set up a firm in the British Virgin Islands in order to transfer the leases of four Welsh opencast mining sites owned by Celtic Energy in order to avoid it having to restore the sites once coal extraction had ended. They had been arrested in 2011 and it took nearly three years to come to court. But after five days of legal submissions, Lord Justice Hickinbottom threw the Serious Fraud Office's case out saying that the six defendants had not acted unlawfully regardless of whether or not they had acted dishonestly. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) applied to the High Court to continue the prosecution under a little-used legal tool called a ""voluntary bill of indictment"" but that was also thrown out. Nearly a year after the case was dismissed, the High Court sitting in Cardiff made a judgement that the legal costs of the multi-million pound case should be paid by the SFO. The costs claim is for Â£7m, to cover the cost of 10 barristers and two separate High Court hearings. The SFO, which disputes it, said it is ""considering possible avenues of appeal"" on the issue of costs. The order to pay the costs has potential ramifications for the SFO, which has been heavily criticised for its handling of other cases including the investigation of the Tchenguiz brothers. That case resulted in the organisation having to pay millions of pounds in costs and damages to the property developers.",A multi-million pound legal bill racked-up in a failed case against six people accused of a fraud conspiracy is to be paid by the Serious Fraud Office.,0.4478448927402496,1547.0,0.8275862068965517,0.08135593220338982,0.14814814814814814,0.2857142857142857,0.027210884353741496,0.04968944099378882,0.3793103448275862,0.03728813559322034,0.06790123456790123,8.8232421875,7.73095703125,6.484212239583333,5.61962890625,4.905615234375

The court heard that Ferguson had been a volunteer at Cancer Research UK for five years before she was employed as a part-time administrator.
She was responsible for handling donations and was trusted with access to the charity's accounts.
Ferguson stole £1,200 by making unauthorized cash withdrawals and transferring the money into her own bank account.
She was caught after a security guard noticed a suspicious transaction and reported it to the police.
Ferguson has no previous convictions and has expressed remorse for her actions.

Arsene Wenger has been charged with misconduct for his reaction to a late penalty awarded to Burnley in a Premier League match at Emirates Stadium.
The Arsenal manager was sent off by referee Jon Moss for verbally abusing fourth official Anthony Taylor after the decision.
Wenger missed Saturday's FA Cup tie against Southampton and will also sit out Premier League games against Watford, Chelsea and Hull.
Burnley scored the late penalty to level the scores at 1-1.
After being sent to the stands, Wenger stood at the tunnel entrance and refused to move, pushing back against Taylor as he tried to watch the remaining minutes of the match.
Wenger apologised after the game, saying he should have kept his control and not spoken.","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been given a four-match touchline ban and £25,000 fine after accepting a Football Association charge of misconduct for his behaviour in the win over Burnley.",0.7186955213546753,601.0,0.59375,0.152,0.24203821656050953,0.1935483870967742,0.04838709677419355,0.07741935483870967,0.34375,0.088,0.14012738853503184,6.6318359375,5.023871527777778,4.007882254464286,3.1546823601973686,2.57763671875

The court in Novorossiysk, a city in southern Russia, has sentenced six dancers to jail and fines for a ""disrespectful"" dance video that prosecutors say desecrated military sites.
The video, which showed the dancers performing a twerk dance at a memorial to fallen soldiers, was deemed ""erotic and sexual"" by prosecutors and deemed unacceptable.
The incident comes as Russia prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the World War Two victory and follows a similar incident in April when a video from a dance school in Orenburg was viewed millions of times on YouTube.
The dancers, who range in age from 14 to 17, were performing at a memorial to fallen soldiers when they were filmed.
The video has been removed from YouTube, but copies continue to circulate on social media.
The court's decision was met with criticism from some who saw it as an infringement on the dancers' artistic freedom.
However, others praised the court for taking action against what they saw as a disrespectful and offensive performance.

Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has accused Germany of ""Nazi practices"" after German authorities cancelled rallies designed to woo ethnic Turkish voters in Germany ahead of a key referendum. The rallies were planned by Turkey's justice minister, but were cancelled by local officials in Gaggenau, Cologne and Frechen. Erdogan said the cancellations showed Germany had ""no relation with democracy"". The Turkish president has also accused Germany of harbouring terrorist groups and described a German-Turkish journalist as an ""agent"" of the PKK Kurdish militants. The journalist, Deniz Yucel, had written about leaked emails that purport to show the influence of Erdogan's son-in-law, who is the country's energy minister. The German government has called for Yucel's release. Turkey and Germany are Nato allies and major trading partners, but their relationship has reached a new low over Erdogan's rhetoric. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said banning Erdogan from visiting Germany or breaking off diplomatic ties would ""play straight into the arms of Putin"".","Turkey's president has compared German officials to Nazis, in the latest escalation in a war of words.",0.5913903713226318,976.0,0.7222222222222222,0.07692307692307693,0.13903743315508021,0.17647058823529413,0.017857142857142856,0.032432432432432434,0.6111111111111112,0.0650887573964497,0.1176470588235294,9.9140625,8.2373046875,6.782366071428571,6.064670138888889,5.137125651041667

The Virtual Doctors charity is a good example of how technology can be used to improve healthcare in remote and rural areas. By using smartphones and tablet computers, health workers in Zambia can receive direct and individual support from volunteer doctors in the UK. This helps to fill the gap in medical provision that exists in many rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. The Virtual Doctors project is now supporting 19 rural health centers and two district hospitals, and the charity wants to expand further to work with other countries in the region.","The idea of a ""virtual doctor"" project might sound rather futuristic.",0.507039487361908,497.0,0.5454545454545454,0.06451612903225806,0.11538461538461539,0.2,0.021739130434782608,0.0392156862745098,0.45454545454545453,0.053763440860215055,0.09615384615384615,12.0859375,10.3671875,9.42578125,8.36328125,7.427001953125

The defendants are accused of passing on information about military zones and other sensitive data to Iranian intelligence.
The charges against them include treason, establishing a spy ring with Iranian intelligence and passing on sensitive data on military zones.
The trial is taking place amid heightened tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have been locked in a regional power struggle.
Saudi Arabia broke off diplomatic relations with Iran in early January following the storming of its embassy in Tehran by protesters angered by the execution of a prominent Saudi Shia cleric and three other Shia.
Saudi officials insisted Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr was guilty of terrorism offences, but Iran's supreme leader said he had been executed solely for his criticism of the Sunni monarchy.
The defendants who went on trial at the Specialised Criminal Court in the capital Riyadh on Sunday were detained in 2013, Saudi media reported.
They include several well-known figures in the Shia community who are not involved in politics, including an elderly university professor, a paediatrician, a banker and two clerics, according to the Reuters news agency.
Eastern Province is home to most of Saudi Arabia's Shia Muslims. They make up less than 15% of the national population, and many claim they suffer discrimination.
Dissent is rarely tolerated in Saudi Arabia, and between 2011 and 2013 more than 20 people were shot dead by security forces and hundreds more detained.
Shootings and petrol bomb attacks also killed several police officers.

Asteroid 2004 BL86 has its own small moon orbiting it, which was discovered during its close flyby of Earth. The asteroid passed by the Earth at a safe distance of 1.2 million km, giving scientists a rare chance to study it 'up close'. The new data shows that the asteroid is about 325m across and its moon is around 70m wide. The asteroid will continue on its orbit around the Sun, and it won't come this close again for another 200 years. The next 'close shave' of a large asteroid is due in 2027, and that object is called 1999 AN10 and is just over 1km wide.","New pictures of asteroid 2004 BL86, which passed close by Earth yesterday, have been released by US space agency Nasa.",0.6319771409034729,480.0,0.5,0.09174311926605505,0.15503875968992248,0.10526315789473684,0.018518518518518517,0.031496062992125984,0.35,0.06422018348623854,0.10852713178294575,10.7109375,8.41015625,6.471571180555555,5.037635216346154,4.27783203125

The number of people crossing the border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland has increased significantly in recent weeks.
The increase is being driven by a combination of factors, including the easing of travel restrictions and the reopening of the border for non-essential travel.
The Republic of Ireland has also seen a surge in tourism, with many people taking advantage of the opportunity to travel abroad for the first time in months.
The increase in border crossings has also been accompanied by a rise in the number of people seeking asylum in the Republic of Ireland.
The Irish government has said it is working to address the issue and is providing support to those seeking asylum.
The increase in border crossings is a positive sign for the economy, with many people crossing the border to work or to do business.
However, it has also led to concerns about the spread of COVID-19, with some fearing that the easing of travel restrictions could lead to a surge in cases.
The Irish government has said it is taking steps to mitigate this risk, including the implementation of strict testing and quarantine measures for those arriving from abroad.",The BBC has learned that the number of illegal immigrants caught trying to get from Northern Ireland's ports to other parts of the UK has risen significantly.,0.5215654373168945,1035.0,0.5357142857142857,0.07537688442211055,0.13215859030837004,0.2222222222222222,0.030303030303030304,0.05333333333333334,0.35714285714285715,0.05025125628140704,0.0881057268722467,11.252604166666666,9.238932291666666,8.04513888888889,6.589092548076923,5.71209716796875

The priest, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was raped by the vicar, who is now dead, in a church and in his home.
He said he was also subjected to physical violence and threatened with violence if he told anyone.
The priest said he had been left with ""psychological damage"" and had struggled to cope with the memories of the abuse.
He said he had tried to report the abuse to the church authorities but had been met with a wall of silence.
The Church of England is currently reviewing a complaint made by the priest against the bishop of Doncaster, who he claims failed to act on his allegations of abuse.
The priest claims that he made the allegations to several senior clergy members between July 2012 and February 2013, but no action was taken.
The Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, and the Bishop of Beverley, Glyn Webster, were also copied in to a letter sent to the former Bishop of Sheffield, Steven Croft, in June 2013, but the priest claims that no action was taken by any of the senior clergy members.
The priest's lawyer, David Greenwood, said that the priest had only spoken out after a safeguarding issue in his own parish ""triggered his memories"".
The Church of England has a one-year time limit for making complaints of misconduct, but the priest has applied for permission to make a complaint out of time, which is currently being considered.
A spokesperson for the Archbishop of York said that he had only received a copy of the letter and that the original recipient of the letter had a duty to respond, not the archbishop.
A spokesperson for the bishops said that if the complaint went forward, ""our bishops will make a full response to the various allegations made in due course"".
A complaint has also been made by the priest against Roy Williamson, a former bishop of Bradford and now an honorary assistant bishop with the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, that he failed to act at the time of the abuse.
A spokesperson for his diocese said that they could not comment during a live investigation, except to say that if approached by the authorities, they would offer every co-operation.
West Yorkshire Police is investigating a report of a historical serious sexual offence said to have occurred in the Bradford area in the 1980s.
The priest, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was raped by a vicar in a church and in his home, and was also subjected to physical violence and threatened with violence if he told anyone.
He said he had been left with ""psychological damage"" and had struggled to cope with the memories of the abuse.
The Church of England is currently reviewing a complaint made by the priest against the bishop of Doncaster, who he claims failed to act on his allegations of abuse.","A priest has accused the Archbishop of York and four bishops of misconduct after they ""failed to act"" on allegations he was raped by a vicar.",0.6743199229240417,2610.0,0.9230769230769231,0.04897959183673469,0.09302325581395349,0.56,0.028629856850715747,0.05447470817120623,0.7307692307692307,0.03877551020408163,0.07364341085271318,9.798177083333334,7.241071428571429,6.289417613636363,5.762416294642857,4.930392795138889

The academy will now focus on its core mission of providing education for students aged 11 to 16.
The Department for Education has agreed to allow Halewood Academy in Knowsley to close its sixth form, which provides A-levels. The academy's principal, Gary Evans, said it was ""sad"" but the closure would leave the academy in a stronger financial position. Education chiefs have pledged to get another A-level plan in place by 2017. Knowsley has the lowest proportion of students taking A-levels in England at 2% and has among the lowest university entry rates in England. The decision was made after considering the quality of provision, the impact on existing students, and the availability of post-16 education in the area. Parents had protested against the closure, arguing it would ""let down the children of this community"" and block their ambitions. Students who are part-way through their studies will be able to continue at the sixth form.

The amnesty offer comes as the UN-backed government in Mogadishu is struggling to regain control of the country after a decade of fighting with al-Shabab.
The militants have been fighting to impose their strict interpretation of Islam on Somalia and have carried out numerous attacks on government and civilian targets.
The group was driven out of the capital in 2011 but still controls large parts of the country.
The amnesty offer is seen as a major shift in the government's approach to dealing with the militants.
The government has previously relied on military force to try to defeat al-Shabab.
The group has also been linked to several attacks in neighboring Kenya.
The amnesty offer has been met with skepticism by some, who say that al-Shabab will not lay down its weapons.
The group has previously rejected similar offers of amnesty.
The government's decision to offer amnesty to al-Shabab fighters has been welcomed by some as a way to end the conflict and bring peace to the country.
The amnesty offer is part of a wider plan to reintegrate former al-Shabab fighters into society.
The government has also announced plans to build new schools and hospitals in areas controlled by al-Shabab.
The amnesty offer comes as the government is facing growing criticism for its handling of the country's drought crisis.
The government has been accused of failing to respond adequately to the crisis, which has left hundreds of thousands of people at risk of starvation.

The Russian opposition has accused President Vladimir Putin of using social media to spread propaganda and disinformation.
In 2014, a law was passed requiring social media companies to store the personal data of Russian users for six months.
The BBC's Russian Service has been tracking the use of social media in Russia and found that many people are turning to it as a way of circumventing state censorship.
The video posted by Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and Putin loyalist, shows him threatening a Kremlin critic with murder. The video, which has more than 16,000 ""likes"", features Kadyrov talking to Vladimir Kara-Murza, a journalist who runs the pro-democracy opposition movement Open Russia. Kasyanov, a former prime minister and high-profile critic of Putin, says he sees the video as a direct death threat and will demand a criminal investigation. Other opposition leaders, including Alexei Navalny, have also condemned the video.

The Caesar photographs, named after the code name given to the photographer, were first published in January 2014 by Qatar, which supports the political and armed opposition in Syria.
Syria's government and its allies have questioned the authenticity of the images, which show the bodies of people who appear to have been tortured and killed.
But on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said it had located and interviewed relatives and friends of 27 victims, as well as former detainees who had seen people die in detention, to provide new evidence of the authenticity of the Caesar photographs.
The group said it had used satellite imagery and geolocation techniques to confirm that some of the photographs were taken in the courtyard of the 601 Military Hospital in Mezzeh, a western suburb of the capital Damascus.
It also identified a coding system for the cards placed on the bodies, and said it had verified dozens of stories from relatives and friends of victims, as well as former detainees who had worked in Syrian government detention centres or the military hospitals where most of the photographs were taken.
The report focused on 28,707 of the 53,275 photos smuggled out of Syria by Caesar, which showed the bodies of at least 6,786 people who died in detention or after being transferred from detention to a military hospital.
The remaining photographs are of attack sites or of bodies identified by name as of government soldiers, other combatants, or civilians killed in attacks, explosions or assassination attempts.
Most of the victims were detained by just five intelligence agency branches in Damascus, and their bodies were sent to at least two military hospitals in Damascus between May 2011, when Caesar began copying files and smuggling them out of his workplace, and August 2013, when he fled Syria.
Forensic pathologists from Physicians for Human Rights analysed a subset of the photos, and found evidence of several types of torture, starvation, suffocation, violent blunt force trauma, and in one case, a gunshot wound to the head.
Among the 27 victims identified by HRW were Rehab al-Allawi, a boy who was 14 at the time of his arrest for having an anti-Assad song on his phone, and student Rehab al-Allawi, who was 25 when she was detained while working with an activist group.
The former detainees, held in the same places as most of the victims, told HRW that guards kept them in severely overcrowded cells with very little air circulation, gave them so little food that they grew weak, and often denied them the opportunity to wash. Skin diseases and other infectious diseases proliferated, and the detainees said guards denied them adequate medical care.
""Many of the former detainees who were held in these nightmarish conditions told us they often wished they would die, rather than continue suffering,"" Mr Houry said.

The protests were aimed at sending a message of opposition to Mr Trump's policies, including his immigration ban and his stance on women's rights.
Theresa May will be the first foreign leader to meet the new US president after his inauguration, as she travels to Washington for talks.
The meeting comes as hundreds of thousands of people around the world join women's marches to protest Donald Trump's presidency.
The Prime Minister's visit is expected to cover a range of issues including Nato, the European Union, defence and Russia.
Mrs May has promised to hold ""very frank"" discussions with Mr Trump, and has already expressed her commitment to the special relationship between the UK and US.
The meeting is politically significant as Brexit negotiations are set to begin, and the fact that Mrs May is meeting the new president so soon will be seen as a sign of the importance of the relationship between the UK and US.
The Prime Minister has already taken steps to build links with the incoming president's team ahead of his inauguration, and has expressed her commitment to the importance of Nato and the special relationship between the UK and US.

Badminton Horse Trials: German rider Michael Jung wins Grand Slam
German rider Michael Jung has won the Grand Slam at the Badminton Horse Trials, emulating Pippa Funnell in 2003.
Jung, 33, had already won at Burghley and Kentucky and completed the treble with a flawless showjumping performance in Sunday's final event.
Andreas Ostholt finished second on So Is Et, with Britain's Gemma Tattersall third on Arctic Soul.
Jung led after each discipline - dressage, cross country and showjumping - and finished with 34.4 penalty points, a record low at Badminton Park.
Tattersall made a firm case for Olympic selection with a flawless showjumping finale, as did Ostholt and Jung, ensuring the places stayed the same as at the end of Saturday's cross country.
Jung will now be a firm favourite to retain his Olympic individual eventing crown and possibly lead his nation to a team title in Rio.
He spoke of La Biosthetique's trust and called the horse ""the best in the world"" on Saturday - perhaps unsurprising considering the pair became the first horse-rider combination to hold Olympic, world and European titles in 2012.
Ominously for Great Britain - who finished second in team eventing at London 2012 - Jung looks to be in relentless mood as he broke a Badminton points record set in 2006.
He also became the first rider to lead from dressage through to conclusion since 2007 but it is the fact he is just the second rider to win a Grand Slam which will make Badminton 2016 live long in the memory of eventing fans.
In all, 46 of the 77 horse-rider combinations which started the week made it to the conclusion.
A strong New Zealand contingent saw Sir Mark Todd place fourth, raising hope he could compete at a seventh Olympic Games at the age of 60.
Todd won individual gold in 1984 and 1988 with a team bronze in Seoul and further bronzes in 2000 (individual) and 2012 (team).","Michael Jung sealed a £240,000 Rolex Grand Slam on La Biosthetique as he became the first German to win a Badminton Horse Trials title.",0.6636183261871338,1753.0,0.84,0.06382978723404255,0.11864406779661017,0.4583333333333333,0.03353658536585366,0.06250000000000001,0.68,0.05167173252279635,0.09604519774011301,10.794921875,9.8466796875,8.384765625,7.1075439453125,5.883510044642857

The programme was criticised by the Russian embassy in London, which called it ""hypocritical and irresponsible"".
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has previously accused the West of trying to contain Russia's influence and of imposing ""unjustified sanctions"" on the country.
In his speech, Mr Medvedev also criticised the West for trying to impose its values on other countries and for trying to contain Russia's influence.

The Russian president's comments come amid growing tensions between Russia and the West over issues such as Ukraine, Syria and alleged Russian interference in Western elections.
The BBC's World War Three: Inside the War Room programme has been criticised by the Russian embassy in London.
The programme imagines a hypothetical Russian attack on its Baltic neighbours - Nato members - and nuclear confrontation.
The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has previously accused the West of trying to contain Russia's influence and of imposing ""unjustified sanctions"" on the country.
The Nato alliance was established in 1949 to protect Western countries.
Russia has recently come under strong criticism over its air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and over its role in neighbouring Ukraine, which culminated with the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014.
Nato has to be able to respond to threats, according to Mr Stoltenberg.

The company's announcement comes after a year of turmoil for the mining industry, with commodity prices plunging and profits tumbling. Anglo American has been hit particularly hard, with its share price falling by more than two-thirds over the past year.
The company has been forced to restructure after the collapse of commodity prices slashed profits. As part of the restructuring, Anglo American's diamonds business will be run by its De Beers subsidiary, its platinum and base metals operations will come under Industrial Metals, and its Bulk Commodities division will concentrate on coal and iron ore. The company will also suspend dividend payments for a year and consolidate from six to three businesses. Anglo American has announced that it will sell its phosphates and niobium businesses during 2016 and plans $3.7bn in cost and productivity improvements by 2017.

The RCN is also looking at the impact of animals on staff well-being, as some nurses have reported feeling stressed or upset by the presence of animals.
The RCN is working on national advice to encourage more animal visitors in hospitals. They have collected scores of anecdotes of therapy-animals, and sometimes pets, helping recovery. Many nurses believe animals could help patients be more physically active and improve physical recovery. However, many nurses also say animals are not allowed where they work due to concerns about infections and other myths around the dangers of allowing animals on wards. The RCN is working on simple rules that could work across wards, clinics, and hospices to address these concerns and encourage more animal visitors.","Hospitals should let more dogs and other animals on to wards and even into operating theatres to help patients, the Royal College of Nursing says.",0.6674225926399231,644.0,0.64,0.13008130081300814,0.21621621621621623,0.125,0.02459016393442623,0.0410958904109589,0.36,0.07317073170731707,0.12162162162162161,8.946614583333334,7.15625,6.421484375,5.621233258928571,5.141888786764706

The government's green paper is also expected to include proposals for a ""comply or explain"" regime for companies, which would require them to explain any pay deals that fall outside the norm.
The proposals are part of a wider effort to increase public trust in business, which has been eroded by a rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment.
The government is also considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role in the reform of remuneration committees.
The proposals come after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards.
The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment.
The proposals will include:
As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role.
Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives.
In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to Â£3.4m.
As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia.
A government source said: ""Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services.
""The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance.
""Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business.""
The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run.
She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week.
Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios.
The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay.
A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent.
It also said that pay ratios do not ""lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies"" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating ""perverse incentives"".
Instead, the report argued for less complex pay structures, a ""Fair Pay Charter"" and giving shareholders more say on executive pay.
The government's green paper is also expected to include proposals for a ""comply or explain"" regime for companies, which would require them to explain any pay deals that fall outside the norm.
The proposals are part of a wider effort to increase public trust in business, which has been eroded by a rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment.","Britain's largest companies will have to reveal the pay gap between their CEOs and average workers, under new government proposals.",0.3838883936405182,3351.0,0.7142857142857143,0.025906735751295335,0.049999999999999996,0.05,0.0017301038062283738,0.003344481605351171,0.5238095238095238,0.018998272884283247,0.03666666666666667,8.529296875,6.24453125,4.976806640625,4.36630859375,3.6812274639423075

The EU is trying to balance the need for solidarity with the need to protect its own citizens.
The UK, which has opted out of EU justice and home affairs policy, is not directly involved in the Dublin Regulation.
The UK has a separate system for processing asylum claims, which is less generous than the EU's.
The UK has also been criticized for its treatment of migrants who arrive by boat, with some being held in detention centers for months.
The UK government argues that it is doing its fair share in helping to deal with the crisis, but critics say it is not doing enough.

Scott's departure marks the end of an era for British swimming, which has enjoyed unprecedented success under his leadership.
The Australian, who has been at the helm of British swimming for eight years, oversaw the development of a new high-performance strategy that led to a 10-fold increase in the number of swimmers achieving Olympic standards.
He also introduced a new approach to coaching, which has seen British swimmers win 12 Olympic medals and 30 World Championship medals.
""I'm proud of what we've achieved together and I'm grateful to the swimmers, coaches, and staff who have been part of this journey,"" Scott said.

The closures have sparked concerns about the impact on local communities and the potential loss of jobs.
The Scottish Government has said it is monitoring the situation closely and is working with banks to ensure that communities are not left without access to banking services.
The text describes the closure of 112 high street banks in Scotland since July 2015, with a further 33 set to close in the coming months. The banks cite changing customer habits as the reason for the closures, but the text notes that the closures have sparked concerns about the impact on local communities and the potential loss of jobs. The text also notes that the banks plan to fill the void left by the closures with online and mobile banking services, but the literal void left by the empty branches on Scotland's high streets could pose a greater challenge to fill.","Scotland is losing more than 140 bank branches over an 18-month period, according to BBC research.",0.5726423263549805,768.0,0.35294117647058826,0.04054054054054054,0.07272727272727274,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23529411764705882,0.02702702702702703,0.048484848484848485,10.85546875,9.259375,8.258370535714286,6.9078125,5.974772135416667

Eisner's offer includes a commitment to invest a further £10m in the club, which would be used to pay off debts and fund a new training ground.

She has been praised for her efforts to improve relations with North Korea and for her stance on climate change, but the scandal has tarnished her reputation.
The scandal centres on accusations that Ms Choi used her friendship with Ms Park to solicit donations for a non-profit foundation she controlled, and that Ms Park allowed her to access government documents.
Ms Choi is in detention facing charges of fraud and abuse of power.
The scandal has also raised questions about the president's judgment and the extent of her involvement in the alleged wrongdoing.
The president has denied any wrongdoing and has said she will cooperate fully with investigators.
But the scandal has left her with a significant political problem, and there are growing calls for her to step down.
The main opposition party said the president's apology lacked sincerity and it called on Ms Park to step back from state affairs.
Scuffles broke out between police and demonstrators demanding Ms Park's resignation in central Seoul on Friday.
Ms Park went on TV to deny allowing cultish rituals to be held in the presidential palace.
She said she took sole responsibility for access to government documents and was willing to be investigated.
She had, she said, ""put too much faith in a personal relationship and didn't look carefully at what was happening"".
Anyone found to have done wrong would be punished, she said, and ""if necessary, I'm determined to let prosecutors investigate me and accept an investigation by an independent counsel too"".
The scandal has left Ms Park with an approval rating of just 5%.
She has already replaced her prime minister, reshuffled her cabinet and dismissed several aides, but there are growing calls for her resignation or impeachment.
Choo Mi-ae, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said she did not believe the apology was genuine and called on her to accept a new prime minister recommended by parliament.
Ms Park became her country's first female president when she was elected in a close-run contest in December 2012.
She has been praised for her efforts to improve relations with North Korea and for her stance on climate change, but the scandal has tarnished her reputation.

The Scottish government is proposing to increase the council tax for some households to raise money for education. The finance secretary, Derek Mackay, gave evidence to a committee in support of the plan, which was formally recommended by the committee to parliament. The proposals would see the average band E household pay about £2 per week more, and the average household in the highest band (H) about £10 a week more. The motion ultimately passed by four votes to two, with an amendment from Green MSP Andy Wightman noting ""concerns"" about wider local tax plans rejected. The government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale's vote failed to register.

The company is now focusing on software, services and enterprise hardware.
The job cuts are part of a wider restructuring plan that will see the company split into two separate entities, with HPE focusing on businesses and government agencies and the PC and printing divisions focusing on the consumer market.
The company currently has more than 300,000 employees and is expected to cut around 55,000 jobs as part of the restructuring plan.
The job cuts are expected to save the company $2.7bn in annual costs, although the plan will cost $2.7bn to carry out.
The new structure proposed by Meg Whitman, the company's chairman and CEO, will see HP Enterprise focusing primarily on businesses and government agencies, and the PC and printing divisions on the consumer market.
The company will not say where the cuts will fall, but part of the plan involves changing the nature of the workforce.
The proportion of workers in what HPE calls ""low-cost locations"" is expected to rise from around 42% now to 60% by 2018.
The tech company has struggled over the last decade to keep up with changing demands as customers move away from desktop computers.
However, Hewlett-Packard is still one of the world's largest technology companies, with revenues this year expected to top $50bn.
The company famously started life in a Palo Alto garage in California in 1939 and grew to be the guiding light of what became known as Silicon Valley.
Its fortunes started to decline with a series of expensive and much criticised acquisitions including Compaq for $25bn in 2002, consultants EDS for $14bn in 2008 and Autonomy for $11bn in 2011.
In 2012 it lost its position as the world's leading supplier of PCs to Lenovo.
The share price peaked at the height of the dot.com boom in 2000, and, despite two surges in 2007 and 2010, it has lost some 60% of its value since then.

The FN's message has shifted from anti-immigration to anti-globalisation, and it has captured votes from far-left and moderate socialists by emphasizing the role of the state. The party has also extended its focus to rural areas and small towns that suffer social deprivation and poor public services. The FN may win a quarter of the votes in this month's European elections, and its appeal may rise further if France's economy deteriorates. The article also raises questions about the FN's extremism and its potential alliance with like-minded parties across Europe.","At the May Day rally, the politician accused the government of ""helping the richest 1%, to reassure credit ratings agencies and international finance"".",0.2274870872497558,619.0,0.34782608695652173,0.064,0.10810810810810811,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.30434782608695654,0.056,0.0945945945945946,10.575520833333334,8.8515625,8.04296875,7.066685267857143,6.373736213235294

The Veterans for Justice UK group has said it will hold a march in Derry on 4 March to highlight ""injustices against soldiers"".
The group's Northern Ireland branch was established in December 2015.
The march is expected to attract about 100 former soldiers.
The group's aims are to protect soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan facing ""false prosecutions"".
The march is seen as a deliberate insult by some, including John Kelly whose brother Michael was killed in the 1972 atrocity.
The Bloody Sunday Trust has described the march as a ""deliberately provocative act"".
The prosecution of those involved in killings is a major stumbling block in efforts to deal with the legacy of Northern Ireland's Troubles.

The Israeli military has also been criticised for its handling of the Gaza Strip, where a 2014 war left more than 2,000 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.
The Israeli government has faced accusations of neglecting the needs of Palestinians in the territory, which is ruled by the Islamist group Hamas.
The comments by Maj-Gen Yair Golan, the deputy chief of staff, on the eve of Thursday's annual Holocaust Day, have caused controversy. He said he detected ""nauseating processes"" in Israeli society that were reminiscent of those that occurred in 1930s Nazi Germany. Mr Netanyahu said the comments were outrageous and caused harm to Israel. Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon said he had ""total confidence"" in Gen Golan. The remarks come at a time of heightened tension between Israelis and Palestinians, with a wave of stabbing, shooting and car-ramming attacks by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs over the past eight months leaving 29 Israelis dead. There has been debate and controversy over Israelis' response to the attacks, with some public sympathy for an Israeli soldier charged with manslaughter after shooting dead a wounded Palestinian.",Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has issued a stern public rebuke to the military deputy chief of staff.,0.3298361301422119,1053.0,0.7058823529411765,0.06486486486486487,0.11881188118811882,0.25,0.021739130434782608,0.04,0.47058823529411764,0.043243243243243246,0.07920792079207921,11.796875,9.57421875,7.582589285714286,6.669704861111111,5.427571614583333

The Palestinian Football Association (PFA) has said it will not remove the request for Israel to be suspended from world football from Fifa's formal agenda, despite attempts to persuade them to do so. The issue will be put to a vote at the Fifa Congress in 2015. The PFA believes that the Israeli government's restrictions on movement in the occupied Palestinian Territory of the West Bank, which restrict the ability of players and officials to get to games, are a violation of human rights. The Palestinians are pursuing a strategy of ""internationalisation"" and see Fifa as a key arena in which to bring their grievances against Israel. The issue has been raised in previous years but was prevented from coming to a vote through backroom deals. This time, however, there will be a vote.",The football bureaucrats of the world were probably expecting to make global headlines as they gathered for the Fifa Congress in Zurich.,0.4442137777805328,683.0,0.5454545454545454,0.08823529411764706,0.1518987341772152,0.19047619047619047,0.02962962962962963,0.05128205128205128,0.4090909090909091,0.0661764705882353,0.11392405063291139,11.09765625,8.6453125,7.31494140625,6.3977272727272725,5.642299107142857

The report was commissioned after Mr Scott told a Stormont committee in April that the emergency-exiting arrangements in the proposed 38,000-capacity stadium were flawed.
The report has recommended that he be replaced as chair of the Safety Technical Group overseeing the Casement project.
The report has called for other personnel changes.
Sports Minister Carál Ní Chuilín has indicated she will implement all of the recommended changes.
The report stated that relationships between the key stakeholders are broken and that an independent mediator will be needed to reset working relationships.
Work on the stadium was supposed to start this year but planning permission was overturned in December 2014.
The report stated that the Casement Park project is behind schedule and has to address two key issues before it can make progress.
It needs to find a way to resolve issues raised with the proposed emergency-exiting arrangements for the stadium.
It also needs to reapply for and achieve planning permission.
The report also included a ""delivery confidence assessment"" that is based on traffic lights, with green being the highest rating.
Casement is rated ""amber/red"".
Although the report recommends that Mr Scott be replaced as chair of the safety technical group, that does not mean he cannot continue to sit on the group.
The report says his replacement will need mediation and facilitation skills ""rather than technical knowledge"".
The chairman of the Stormont committee which is investigating Mr Scott's allegations said the Cabinet Office report ""is part of the resolution but only part"".
Democratic Unionist Party MLA Nelson McCausland said the minister and her officials had more questions to answer.
""This coming week we'll be convening a special meeting of the committee at Stormont and we will be requesting that the minister and the permanent secretary appear before the committee to answer the questions that we will be putting to them,"" he said.",A report into the planned new stadium at Casement Park in Belfast has recommended the replacement of senior figures from key posts in the project.,0.4800229370594024,1822.0,0.72,0.05642633228840126,0.1046511627906977,0.125,0.009433962264150943,0.017543859649122806,0.48,0.03761755485893417,0.06976744186046513,11.859375,10.350260416666666,8.847222222222221,7.882486979166667,6.891276041666667

The UK government has always maintained that its intelligence agencies' activities are lawful and necessary to protect national security.

However, the groups have now been granted permission to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal.

The charity said the new technology would provide an alternative to road ambulance journeys, offering significantly quicker transport of vulnerable babies between hospitals. The service began carrying Babypods for emergency missions in 2013. But the new incubators will attach to existing equipment in the helicopter, providing warmth and oxygen. They also have a transparent chamber, allowing babies to be monitored during flights. Welsh medics went to Switzerland to help in the design process and, at a cost of Â£70,000 each, two new incubators have been bought by NHS Wales. They will be used on Wales Air Ambulance's newest helicopter, the fourth in its fleet. Weighing 15st 10lb (100kg), the incubators will be fitted to a sled and require two people to lift them into the air ambulance. Since April 2015, helicopter crews have been joined on board by consultant doctors. Dr Dindi Gill, the Emergency Medical Retrieval and Transfer Service Cymru interim director, said: ""Having the incubator system will further enhance the ability of the EMRTS teams to manage neonates born at home or in hospital. ""It is recognised that temperature control is extremely important to this group of patients and, therefore, we welcome the ability to carry the incubator on Wales Air Ambulance's helicopters.""

The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued a travel advisory warning its citizens about the risks of traveling to North Carolina and Mississippi due to new laws that allow businesses to refuse service to LGBT people. The advisory comes after newly passed legislation in both states invalidates previously passed legislation from Charlotte and Jackson that enacted LGBT protections. The laws also have provisions that allow transgender people to use public bathrooms according to the gender on their birth certificates. The advisory is both frightening and embarrassing, said Ty Cobb of the Human Rights Campaign. It is now more clear than ever that these terrible measures are not only harming individuals and taking an economic toll on the states, but are also causing serious damage to our nation's reputation, and the perceived safety of LGBT people who travel here. The laws have sparked controversy and protests across the country, with more than a dozen states passing or considering ""religious liberty"" laws. Supporters argue that the bills protect religious beliefs, but most critics say they are actually legalized discrimination.

The former prime minister's lawyers are also exploring the possibility of appealing his conviction to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, arguing that he was the victim of a politically motivated trial.
In the meantime, Mr Berlusconi is free to continue his political activities, including campaigning for local elections in his home region of Emilia-Romagna.
He has already announced that he will be standing as a candidate for mayor of Milan, a city he governed for many years.
The text describes how a law aimed at reducing prison overcrowding allows senior citizens convicted of certain crimes to choose between house arrest and performing socially useful tasks. Ordinary criminals can be assigned to work in centers for drug addicts, soup kitchens for the homeless, or looking after the elderly. However, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is 77, faces a possible ban on holding public office and will almost certainly be stripped of his seat in the Senate. He was due to begin serving his sentence this week, but bureaucratic delays in the Italian judiciary are legendary, and it now appears that no decision will be made by the authorities for at least six months as to how he is to pay off his debt to society. Berlusconi can propose what organization he would like to join, but there is no guarantee that he will be assigned to the charity or the soup kitchen of his choice. The media mogul can also propose serious and less-than-serious offers, such as going on stage to tell his own jokes at a street circus in Naples or helping a human rights group lobby for the abolition of the death penalty.","Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi - whose four-year sentence for tax fraud has been reduced to 12 months under an amnesty - has submitted a formal request to perform a year of community service, instead of being confined to the gilded cage of one of his luxury homes under house arrest.",0.7160686254501343,1401.0,0.5490196078431373,0.0989399293286219,0.16766467065868262,0.16,0.028368794326241134,0.048192771084337345,0.3137254901960784,0.05653710247349823,0.09580838323353293,8.295758928571429,6.794363839285714,5.711030505952381,4.762381417410714,3.8863525390625

The study, led by the University of Cambridge, used 40 sensors to measure poisonous nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels around Heathrow airport.

However, the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF) said the research was ""highly speculative"" and there was no guarantee pollution levels would fall. The work was led by the University of Cambridge and has no formal links to any airport or the government. The study suggests that as cleaner engines kick in, levels of NO2 will fall again, although opponents argue that air quality is the Achilles heel for Heathrow expansion and could be where it is challenged in the courts.

The blogger's case has sparked a debate about freedom of speech and the role of religion in Mauritania.
Mauritania has not applied the death penalty since 1987, but the Forum of Imams and Ulemas is calling for Mohamed Ould Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir to be executed despite his repentance for an article criticizing the country's caste system. The clerics want him to be killed according to the ""law of God."" The blogger was arrested in January 2014 for an article in which he criticized those who use religion as a means of discrimination against members of certain ethnic groups. The article was later taken down as it was deemed blasphemous towards the Prophet Muhammad. Mkhaitir then apologized and said he never meant to insult the Prophet. Mauritania's Supreme Court can pardon him if it feels his repentance is sincere. But ahead of the court's decision on Tuesday, the Forum of Imams and Ulemas said the blogger should not be shown any mercy. ""We demand that the competent authorities apply the law. Kill him and bury him in conformity with the law of God,"" the statement added. Leading rights groups, including Freedom Now and the Committee to Protect Journalists, have campaigned for the blogger's release. Freedom Now, which represents him, said his trial was marred by procedural irregularities and that three of his lawyers had to resign after receiving death threats. Mauritania's caste system is a sensitive subject in a country with deep social and racial divisions. It has served as justification for the enslavement of members of Mauritania's Haratin ethnic group, often known as the ""black moors."" Last year, Mauritania introduced a tough new anti-slavery law which makes the offense a ""crime against humanity.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 21,409.07 and the S&P 500 edged down 0.08% to 2,425.53. The Nasdaq rose 0.3% to 6,193.3.
Wall Street has generally climbed this year, in spite of some shaky moments stemming from unease over the fate of the Trump administration and prospects for its business-friendly agenda.
Markets also sank in May amid a furore over US President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, who had been investigating ties between the campaign and Russia. That investigation is ongoing.
On Tuesday, a rise in oil prices helped lift energy stocks, such as Exxon Mobil, which climbed 0.6%. But bank stocks lost ground ahead of the release of quarterly earnings this week and a day after the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau unveiled a rule making it easier for customers to file collective lawsuits. The rule forbids companies from requiring that people use an individual, out-of-court process to resolve disputes as part of the contract for their credit card and bank accounts. Bank of America and Citigroup shares fell 1.2% on Tuesday, while Wells Fargo dropped 1%. The rule may be short-lived as it comes amid a push by the White House and Republicans in Congress to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau less powerful.

The students are also seeking partners to help them bring the technology to market.
""We're looking for investors, partners, and people who can help us with the commercialization of the technology,"" says Mr van Cappellen.
""We're not just a student project, we're a company.""
Team Fast is already in talks with several potential partners, including bus manufacturers and fuel station operators.
""We're not just a student project, we're a company,"" says Lucas van Cappellen, the founder of Team Fast.
""We're building our own future.""
The students are developing emissions-free transport that will help in the global battle against climate change. They are using formic acid, a much cheaper solution than hydrogen, yet it delivers the same environmental benefits. The fuel, hydrozine, is a liquid, which means you can transport it easily and refill vehicles quickly. The tailpipe emissions are only CO2 and water, no other harmful gases like nitric oxides, soot or sulphuric oxides are emitted. The bus has an electric drive system, developed by bus builder VDL, that receives additional power from the formic acid fuel cell system mounted in a range-extender trailer, towed behind. The hydrozine is created through a chemical reaction between water and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen is then added to a fuel cell where it reacts with oxygen to generate the electricity that powers the electric motor. The students are seeking partners to help them bring the technology to market.","A group of students has developed a way of storing energy that could be cheaper to make, more practical and more sustainable than alternative renewable fuels.",0.4299001097679138,1335.0,0.5,0.053497942386831275,0.09665427509293681,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.03292181069958848,0.05947955390334573,10.205729166666666,8.410807291666666,7.526475694444445,6.5516826923076925,5.9222412109375

The incident occurred after a news conference in Florida, where Mr Lewandowski is accused of grabbing Ms Fields' arm when she tried to ask Mr Trump a question, leaving a bruise. Mr Lewandowski plans to plead not guilty, and the Trump campaign said he is ""absolutely innocent"" of the charge. The police in Jupiter, Florida, have released new footage of the alleged assault.

The review is examining the progress of 56 cases involving 97 deaths, including killings by police officers and soldiers, and allegations of state collusion. The review is being conducted by Lord Justice Weir, the presiding judge of the Coroners' Service, who is spending the next two weeks conducting preliminary hearings to assess the state of readiness of each case. Families of those who were killed and their legal teams have been asked to inform the court of the issues which are outstanding in each of the cases. The stalled inquests into the Army shootings of 10 people in Ballymurphy, west Belfast, in 1971, and of five more civilians in nearby Springhill a year later, were examined on the opening day in Laganside Courts. The cases focusing on nine deaths linked to the Royal Ulster Constabulary's (RUC) alleged ""shoot to kill"" policy in the 1980s were also assessed. A barrister for families of two INLA members shot dead by the RUC in 1982 criticised police after they said disclosure could not be completed ahead of a proposed September 2017 inquest date. A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) representative told the court at least another year would be required. The barrister for the Grew and Carroll families accused the police of failing to honour a series of similar disclosure commitments since the cases were re-opened in 2007. Ahead of the review, a senior police officer said the disclosure delays were due to the huge pressures being placed upon the PSNI's Legacy Support Unit (LSU). When the review is completed, a coroner will be appointed to hear inquests identified as ready to proceed. In the others, relevant parties will be instructed to provide any outstanding material needed for an inquest to take place. Some of the hearings are expected to take place later this year. The most complex and controversial ones are likely to be heard by a High Court judge, while others will be heard by a County Court judge. Justice Minister David Ford last year authorised the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service to recruit ""investigative support"" for coroners dealing with the legacy inquests. The review was announced by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan in October, a month before he was appointed president of the Coroners' Courts. Sir Declan said he wanted to assure the families of those who were killed that he was ""fully committed to doing all that I can, within my sphere of influence and with the resources at my disposal, to ensure that justice is delivered"". But he also warned that it could be ""many years"" before most of the cases could be dealt with. Only nine legacy cases have been disposed of during the past five years, and 13 cases in total in the past 10 years. In November 2014, Sir Declan warned that inquests into deaths involving alleged state collusion and cover-up could go on until 2040 unless the coronial inquests system was changed.",A major review of inquests into some of the most controversial killings during the Troubles got under way on Monday.,0.5098538398742676,2788.0,0.7,0.028282828282828285,0.05436893203883496,0.2631578947368421,0.010121457489878543,0.019493177387914232,0.65,0.026262626262626262,0.05048543689320388,11.84765625,9.55859375,8.04931640625,6.96484375,5.6527569110576925

The refugees are being supported by the Red Cross and other organizations.
The first group of Syrian refugees arrived in Northern Ireland in December 2015.
Since then, a total of 98 refugees have arrived in the country.
The war in Syria has claimed the lives of more than 250,000 people.
Some of the refugees in Derry were at the North West Regional College on Tuesday to find out more about learning courses.
Bayan Khello, 18, had to leave many of her family behind, including her brother who is currently in Germany.
Bayan spoke to BBC Radio Foyle through an interpreter.
""I still have family in Turkey and Aleppo, the sons of my cousin are still there, we have put in an application to have our family unified here.
""My uncle and my cousin were killed in the war. My cousin was going back from his work when a sniper shot him in the chest. That was one of my worst days,"" she said.
Bayan, who wears a free Syria wristband in the colors of her native country, said she did not want to leave her home.
""I didn't want to leave Aleppo, I wasn't eating for two months. Then my father told me 'We have to live our life now, we have to make a new start'.
""I saw houses knocked down with children underneath, its time to end this war, its enough.""
Bayan, who has a degree in accountancy, said she does not yet know what kind of life she will have in Northern Ireland, but she wants to study hard and learn English.
Yasser Al Satton left his home in Syria after chemical weapons were used in the area.
""Within the last month the house of one my relations was bombed and ten people were killed.
""Everything that comes to your mind, we lived it and we saw it. One of my relation's lost both of his hands when a bomb exploded.
""If we had hope that the war would end we would have stayed but I don't believe the war will end,"" he said.
Yasser said that he was adjusting to his new life in the North West very well.
A particular highlight was how friendly the people of Derry have been.
""Everybody says: 'Hello, how are you, how are you doing, what's the craic?"" he added.

The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States and has the final legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues, from abortion to gender to gun control. If confirmed by the Senate, Judge Neil Gorsuch would restore the court's conservative majority, lost with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The Senate Democratic leader has said he has ""very serious doubts"" about Gorsuch's nomination. Gorsuch was picked from a shortlist of 21 choices made public during the election campaign and has been described as a conservative's dream. If successful, his nomination will restore the 5-4 conservative majority on the nine-seat high court. Protests against Trump's choice were held outside the Supreme Court following the announcement. Gorsuch has not spoken out about Roe v Wade, the case which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973, making it difficult to pin down where he stands on the issue. He has supported religious institutions which objected to requirements for employers to provide access to contraception and defended the religious owners of retailer Hobby Lobby who refused to fund birth control via staff health insurance.

The research by William C Campbell, Satoshi Omura and Youyou Tu has led to drugs to treat diseases affecting more than 3.4 billion people around the world.
One of the drugs, ivermectin, was discovered by William C Campbell after studying bacteria found in soil samples obtained by Satoshi Omura from a Japanese golf course in Ito City, in the Shizuoka region.
Ivermectin kills the first larval stage of the parasite, which causes river blindness and elephantiasis.
Merck and Co has given ivermectin away free to those countries that need it most since 1987, donating more than 300 million doses in 2022.
Youyou Tu discovered artemisinin, a drug used to treat malaria, by testing an extract from the sweet wormwood plant on herself and animals in her lab.
The World Health Organization credits the expanding access to artemisinin-based combination therapies in malaria-endemic countries as a key factor in driving down deaths in recent years.

The French government has said it will not close the Port of Calais again during the summer.
The UK government has said it is working closely with the French authorities to ensure disruption is minimized.
The M20 motorway in Kent, England, was closed for several days due to Operation Stack, a queuing system for lorries waiting to cross the Channel. The closure caused significant disruption to the UK economy, with an estimated daily cost of Â£250m and queues of 4,600 lorries stretching back 30 miles. The closure was caused by strike action by MyFerryLink workers and an attempt by migrants to storm the Channel Tunnel. The problem is not only caused by strikes and migrants, but also by winter storms and high winds. There have been calls for an alternative solution to Operation Stack, with some suggesting a lorry park to ""take the sting out of Stack.""

The event was halted after a complaint from the Vietnamese embassy in Bangkok.
Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said the event was cancelled to avoid causing any ""unnecessary tension"" between the two countries.
The event was due to feature a speech by the HRW's senior Southeast Asia researcher, Phil Robertson, who has been critical of the Thai government's human rights record.
The Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand said it was ""very disappointed"" by the cancellation.
The event was the third human rights event at the venue to be halted by authorities in the past month.
The HRW report describes what it says is the persecution of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's central highlands.

Tomkins' return to Wigan is a boost for the club, who are looking to challenge for the Super League title next season after finishing third in 2015.
The move also ends a brief but high-profile stint in the NRL for Tomkins, who was signed by the Warriors in a deal that made him the highest-paid player in the competition's history.
Tomkins, who was born in Wigan, had been linked with a move to Salford before agreeing to return to the club where he made his name.
Wigan have paid ""in excess of £200,000"" to re-sign Tomkins, who had a year remaining on his contract with the New Zealand Warriors. Tomkins, 26, will return to the club for the 2016 Super League season. He had been playing in the NRL for the past four years but is now looking forward to being closer to his family and friends.

The article discusses how the decline of American influence in the world has occurred over the past 15 years, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the financial crisis, and the NSA and Wikileaks scandals all contributing to a perception that the US is less reliable and less effective in promoting its interests and values around the world. The article suggests that this decline in influence has been accompanied by a decline in the willingness of the American people to support their government's efforts to maintain global leadership, with a growing sense that other countries should share the burden of maintaining order in the world.

The BBC's plans for a children's iPlayer and a network of local reporters who will share work with local newspapers are part of its response to the government's charter review.
The corporation is seeking to become an ""open BBC for the internet age"" and is planning to work with cultural institutions and thinkers to make Britain the ""greatest cultural force in the world"".
The director general, Lord Hall, said the BBC would make ""bigger and bolder drama"" and would allow producers, directors, writers and artists to have the ""creative freedom to do things they would find it harder to do elsewhere"".
The BBC is facing funding cuts and has already made 40% of its revenues in the current charter period. It is now proposing to save close to another 20% over the next five years.
The corporation is also planning to launch an ""Ideas Service"" which will be an ""open online platform"" featuring material from galleries, museums and universities as well as the BBC itself.
The BBC is facing criticism for its plans to share news with local newspapers and for its proposal to have a network of 100 public service reporters across the country.
The Scottish Newspaper Society has described the proposal to share news with local newspapers as a ""Trojan horse"" that will undermine long-established publications and destroy local news agencies"".
The News Media Association has also expressed concerns about the corporation's plans, saying they represent ""BBC expansion into local news provision and recruitment of more BBC local journalists through the back door"".

The win was a timely boost for the Toffees, who have been struggling in the Premier League this season.
The game was a classic example of a team that was not good enough to win a game of football. Burnley were the better team and deserved to win.
Their performance was a credit to their manager Sean Dyche, who has done a fantastic job in transforming the Clarets from a team that struggled to stay up into a team that is now challenging for a place in Europe.
The win was also a reminder that the Premier League is not just about the big clubs. There are plenty of teams that can upset the odds and Burnley are certainly one of them.
The game was also a reminder that referees have a tough job to do and they are not always going to get it right. The decision to award Burnley a penalty was controversial and some might argue that it was the turning point of the game.
However, the referee had a tough game and was probably trying to do his best. The game was also a reminder that football is a game of opinions and people will always have different views on what they have seen.
The win was a great result for Burnley and it was a great performance by the team. They played some excellent football and they were well worth their victory.

The visit comes as the US and other Western countries lift sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran agreeing to curb its nuclear programme.
Iran's economy has been battered by the sanctions, which were imposed over its nuclear programme.
The lifting of the sanctions is expected to boost Iran's economy, which has been in recession for years.
Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, is expected to secure valuable trade deals following the lifting of international sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme. He will meet with French President Francois Hollande and is expected to sign contracts with French car manufacturers Peugeot and Renault, as well as Airbus for more than 100 new aircraft.

The GIB was set up to provide long-term financing for green projects, with the aim of reducing the UK's carbon footprint and boosting economic growth.
It has invested in a range of projects, including wind farms, solar parks, and energy-efficient buildings.
The bank's annual review showed that it had lent £1.3bn to 20 projects in the past year, with a further £1.2bn in the pipeline.
The bank's chairman, Lord Smith, said: ""We have shown that green investment can be profitable and attractive to investors.
""We have also demonstrated that the bank can be a catalyst for private sector investment in the green economy.""
The GIB's annual review also showed that it had helped to create or protect more than 1,000 jobs in the past year.
The bank's success has led to calls for it to be expanded, with some arguing that it should be given more powers to invest in infrastructure projects.

The Turing Test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior that is indistinguishable from that of a human. It was first proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 as a way to determine whether machines can think.

The UK government has proposed a plan to limit the amount of tax credits paid to new EU migrants for up to four years. The plan, which is part of a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership of the EU, would allow the UK to trigger an ""emergency brake"" if it could be proven that high levels of migration were putting an extreme strain on the UK's benefits system. However, many Tory MPs have criticized the plan, saying it is a watered-down version of the total four-year ban the PM was hoping for and that new migrants would still receive ""graduated"" rates of in-work benefits over the four year period and the full amount after that. Additionally, the brake would have to be approved by other EU nations and the UK could not apply it unilaterally. The European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, has defended the proposals and the rest of the draft deal, saying that the entire package is ""fair to the UK and fair to the other 27 EU states.""","Limiting in-work benefits to new EU arrivals will help tackle the effects of record migration to the UK since 2004, the EC's president has said.",0.5980809330940247,844.0,0.6296296296296297,0.09497206703910614,0.1650485436893204,0.23076923076923078,0.033707865168539325,0.0588235294117647,0.48148148148148145,0.07262569832402235,0.1262135922330097,10.419270833333334,8.539620535714286,6.893643465909091,5.894010416666666,5.2601768092105265

The applicant in this case had invested £100,000 in a boiler and was accredited to the scheme in January 2016.
He was eligible only for payments limited by cost controls.
His first annual payment had been £5,200, taking him just above the £5,000 limit under which companies are not named.
The court was told his client could not ""avail of uncapped or untiered payments"", but the department was not drawing that distinction in the information it planned to publish.
The applicant claimed the publication of recipients' details would not differentiate between those on a capped scheme and those who had benefitted from earlier, more generous tariffs.
The department's barrister said the date of application would be included in the information to be published.
He said that would allow the discerning reader to differentiate which tariff applied to the applicant.
And he said it would show the applicant had not sought to get into the scheme during a huge spike in applications in Autumn 2015.
The barrister said it was important that information was published ""wholesale"" so that the public could see the scheme's cost controls were working.
The department has already published a list of limited companies that receive RHI subsidies.
But under data protection regulations, they had to give people who had applied under their own names the opportunity to explain why their details should not be made public.
The deadline for receipt of that information expires on Wednesday.
The court heard the department planned to publish the information next week.
Since April 2017, all RHI recipients have been moved to the capped and tiered scheme.

The ONS also publishes a separate monthly estimate of unemployment based on tax records, which shows a fall of 10,000 in unemployment.
The ONS says this is a more reliable measure of unemployment, but it is not seasonally adjusted and is therefore subject to more variation.
The UK's unemployment rate fell to 4.9% in August, down from 5.5% a year earlier, but little changed from last month's report, according to the Office for National Statistics. The growth in average weekly earnings including bonuses slowed slightly to an increase of 2.3% on last year. The proportion of people in work hit a record high of 74.5%. The ONS said the figures, which only cover one month since the result of the EU referendum, show ""continuing improvement"" in the jobs market. However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that the rise in people in work ""remains supported by surging self-employment"" and that the strong growth also reflected a shift towards part-time working; total weekly hours rose by just 0.3% between April and July. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the labour market is ""still waiting for the Brexit effect"", but that it will ""gradually become clear over the next few months"". In August the claimant count, including Jobseeker's Allowance, actually went up from the previous month by 2,400 to 771,000. The claimant count is treated with some caution by economists as the move to Universal Credit has made it much harder to calculate. One interesting nugget in the employment figures concerns the number of people employed in the public sector. It is down to 5.33 million, the lowest level since the Office for National Statistics started collecting the figures in 1999 and a drop of 13,000 since March. The former chancellor, George Osborne, often spoke about the need to ""rebalance"" the economy. To an extent, he meant away from financial services and towards manufacturing. But, more privately, he was actually very comfortable with an economy that was ""rebalancing"" away from the public sector towards the private sector, where wealth, he would argue, is actually created. As cuts and wage freezes bite, the public sector has become less attractive as a place to build a career. Yes, employment is at record levels, but it is the private sector that is on the up. The unemployment estimates come from the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to 40,000 households every three months. Although it is a very large survey, there is still a margin of error. The ONS says it is 95% confident that the figure of a 39,000 fall in unemployment is correct to within 78,000. As the estimated change is smaller than the margin of error, it means the change in unemployment is not statistically significant. The ONS also publishes a separate monthly estimate of unemployment based on tax records, which shows a fall of 10,000 in unemployment. The ONS says this is a more reliable measure of unemployment, but it is not seasonally adjusted and is therefore subject to more variation.","The number of people without jobs and looking for work fell by 39,000 to 1.63 million between May and July, official figures show.",0.4142407774925232,2922.0,0.76,0.03612167300380228,0.0689655172413793,0.20833333333333334,0.009523809523809525,0.018214936247723135,0.52,0.024714828897338403,0.04718693284936479,8.041666666666666,5.513671875,4.790234375,4.172154017857143,3.6893669577205883

The family of Sukhjit Singh, who was found dead in his bed in India, are launching a legal battle against the police who they claim are trying to frame his wife Ramandeep Kaur Mann for his murder. The couple's friends in Derby said the news came as a shock and their priority was the couple's young children, who remain with their grandmother in India. The family were visiting Sukhjit's mother in Banda, about 450km (280 miles) south east of New Delhi, and were due to fly home earlier this month. Local police said the Derby man was found dead in his mother's house with his throat slit and having sustained head injuries on 1 September. They accused Ramandeep and Gurpeet of being lovers and arrested Gurpeet as he attempted to board a flight to Dubai. Gurpal Singh worked with Sukhjit at the National Sikh Museum in Derby and saw the family the night before they flew to India. ""We all really want to know the truth. All we've heard are reports in the media and we are concerned the story is being repeated without a proper investigation,"" he said. ""We are all in shock. They are a lovely family - he was a devout and humble man. There was nothing to suggest anything was wrong at home. ""I'm not questioning what the Indian police have said but we would all like to see a proper investigation of what has happened.""

The deal was reached after a year of negotiations between Iran and the six powers - the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China.
The six powers had been demanding that Iran suspend all enrichment of uranium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons.
Iran had refused to do so, saying it needed to continue enriching to produce electricity and for medical purposes.
The deal will see Iran limit its enrichment activities, ship out some of its stockpile of higher-grade enriched uranium, and give more inspections of its nuclear facilities.
In return, the international community will ease some sanctions on Iran, which has been battered by economic sanctions over its nuclear programme.
The deal is seen as a significant step towards resolving a decade-long standoff over Iran's nuclear programme.
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has criticised the deal, warning that it could lead to Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.
Saudi Arabia, which has been a vocal critic of Iran, has welcomed the deal but said it would wait to see if Iran abides by its commitments.
The deal was reached in Geneva on Sunday and was immediately welcomed by the US and EU.
The interim agreement will last for six months, during which time negotiations will continue on a more permanent solution.
The deal will see Iran limit its enrichment activities, ship out some of its stockpile of higher-grade enriched uranium, and give more inspections of its nuclear facilities.
In return, the international community will ease some sanctions on Iran, which has been battered by economic sanctions over its nuclear programme.
The deal is seen as a significant step towards resolving a decade-long standoff over Iran's nuclear programme.
Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has criticised the deal, warning that it could lead to Iran obtaining nuclear weapons.
Saudi Arabia, which has been a vocal critic of Iran, has welcomed the deal but said it would wait to see if Iran abides by its commitments.
The deal was reached in Geneva on Sunday and was immediately welcomed by the US and EU.

Indonesia's economy has been hurt by weak commodity prices and a slowdown in its key trading partner, China. Despite government spending, the economy only grew by 5% in the last quarter of 2015. Analysts say growth is unlikely to improve in the near future. The government is facing problems boosting spending and has seen several large infrastructure projects delayed. The $5.5bn high-speed railway project, funded by China, is scheduled to be completed by 2019 but has faced objections from transport experts and questions about its long-term viability. The country has also faced international condemnation for its man-made forest fires, which have caused serious economic and environmental damage. The World Bank says the fires last year cost the country more than twice the amount spent on reconstruction efforts after the 2004 Aceh tsunami.","Growth in South East Asia's largest economy, Indonesia, has come in at 4.76% for 2015, marking the fifth consecutive yearly decline.",0.4741904437541961,748.0,0.43478260869565216,0.072992700729927,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2608695652173913,0.043795620437956206,0.075,8.9169921875,6.970703125,5.8994140625,5.0765380859375,4.217866443452381

The video shows a group of young men, armed with knives and machetes, attacking a man in a residential area. The man is beaten and stabbed multiple times, and eventually dies from his injuries. The attackers then flee the scene.
The video is a shocking example of the ongoing violence that plagues many parts of the world, particularly in areas with high levels of poverty and unemployment. It is also a reminder of the dangers of vigilantism and the importance of the rule of law.
The video has been widely shared on social media, and has sparked outrage and condemnation from many quarters. It has also raised questions about the role of the media in reporting such incidents, and the potential impact on public opinion and political discourse.
The massacre is a tragic reminder of the need for greater investment in education, job training, and community programs to address the root causes of violence and promote peace and stability. It is also a call to action for governments and communities to work together to address the underlying social and economic issues that contribute to violence and conflict.","In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces killed more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims who were meant to be under UN protection.",0.3070306181907654,1020.0,0.09523809523809523,0.0106951871657754,0.01923076923076923,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.0106951871657754,0.01923076923076923,10.819010416666666,8.145647321428571,5.814985795454546,4.846470424107143,3.9073350694444446

The Kidman cattle empire, Australia's largest landholding, was put on sale for A$325m in April but was blocked by the government in June. The company, founded by Sir Sidney Kidman in 1899, owns 19 properties across the Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia, encompassing 101,411 sq km of land. The sale was blocked due to part of the property being inside the Woomera Prohibited Area, a military weapons testing range in South Australia. The government may be willing to see Kidman broken for sale, but it is unclear if foreign investors would maintain the company's focus on growing grass-fed beef for domestic and international markets.

The Yemeni government has been struggling to contain the rise of militancy in the country, which has been exacerbated by political instability and economic hardship.
The group's previous threats to launch attacks on the authorities have not been carried out, but its ability to carry out suicide attacks and armed assaults suggests that it has the capability to do so.

The Yemeni government has been struggling to contain the rise of militancy in the country, which has been exacerbated by political instability and economic hardship.",An offshoot of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has issued a statement threatening the lives of 73 Yemeni soldiers it says it captured last week.,0.5531565546989441,833.0,0.37037037037037035,0.062111801242236024,0.10638297872340426,0.038461538461538464,0.00625,0.010752688172043012,0.2962962962962963,0.049689440993788817,0.0851063829787234,8.2734375,6.256293402777778,5.255709134615385,4.383843315972222,3.8257501775568183

The research will help scientists understand how the monsoon over India might change in the future, and how this could impact the economy and agriculture.
The study of past climate change can provide valuable insights into how the Earth might respond to future climate change.
The sediment samples collected from beneath the Indian Ocean are being used to reconstruct past rainfall and temperature records, shedding light on the impact of climate change on the Indian monsoon.
The research is part of a larger-scale study of the Asian monsoon, which is formed due to intense heat from the Sun in late spring, warming the Northern Indian Ocean, along with the plains of northern India and the Tibetan Plateau, resulting in 75% of the year's rain falling between June and September.

Burke's move to Leipzig means he will be playing in the same league as his former team-mate Chris Wood, who joined the club from Leicester City in January.
The 24-year-old New Zealand international, who scored 11 goals in 27 appearances for Forest last season, is expected to be a key player for the German side.
Burke, who has been capped at Under-19 and Under-21 level, is now hoping to force his way into Strachan's plans for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia.
The Scotland boss has already hinted that he may give Burke a chance in the starting line-up, saying: ""He's a young player with a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to working with him.""
Burke's switch to the Bundesliga means he will be playing against the likes of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04, and he is relishing the challenge.
""I'm excited to be joining RB Leipzig and can't wait to get started,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to playing against the best players in the world and learning from them.""
Burke's move to Leipzig has been a surprise to many, but the teenager is determined to prove his worth in the Bundesliga.
""I'm not here to make up the numbers,"" he said. ""I want to be a success and help the club achieve its goals.""","He's been compared to Gareth Bale, fast-tracked into the national squad, and was linked with a transfer to some of the top clubs in Europe before becoming the most expensive ever Scottish player - all after only 13 starts for his club.",0.3200720250606537,1064.0,0.46511627906976744,0.08403361344537816,0.1423487544483986,0.047619047619047616,0.008438818565400843,0.014336917562724014,0.3488372093023256,0.06302521008403361,0.10676156583629892,9.9984375,7.7350852272727275,6.731689453125,5.860529119318182,5.124348958333333
