Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, has backed the immediate transfer","Miss Sturgeon made the call in debate at King's College, Aberdeen, tonight .
Said she wants powers 'as quickly as the other parties agree to give them'
Scots Labour leader Jim Murphy said move would ruin country's finances .
Drop in value of North Sea oil would mean a £7.6bn hole in the budget .
Mr Rennie, who openly admitted the LibDems had broken a promise not to raise tuition fees, cautioned Miss Sturgeon against breaking her promise that last year's referendum was a 'once-in-a-generation' vote.
Miss Davidson was forced to accept the UK Government could not stand in the way of another referendum.

A new report reveals that the United States began secretly tracking phones long before the events","It has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1992 .
The program forced phone companies to hand over all communication on a daily basis between any Americans calling any 116 watch list countries .
The data collected included phone numbers and time calls were made, though actual content was not included .
The program was approved by every administration beginning with President George H.W.Bush .
It was only shut down in September 2013, this after Attorney General Eric Holder became nervous in the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks .
