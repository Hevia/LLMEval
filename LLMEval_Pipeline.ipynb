Should I fear retaliation and if so how can I protect myself?? \\n UPDATE 1 : made an appointment with a detective at the pd, I realized my personal safety is worth more than the car, but I have to do something now since the \"mom\" explicitly doesn\\'t want the car. I will post the legal advice i received after the meeting. Also anthrax was a joke what I meant was sliced break cables, or other mechanical manipulations. Also can\\'t report as stolen since I received money from the man contract or no contract. \\n UPDATE 2  Talked to the detective, he told me given the situation, they probably just want to get rid of it. But since no one has the pink slip (its lost) I need to get the car back ASAP, he said even if its stripped just get it back, and sell it to carmax next time. Anyway, Im going to try to go down tonight with a few friends, but the mom hasn\\'t responded to my texts or calls. The officer told me eventually his curb dealing shit will get caught, but my main priority is to go get it back before he runs someone over someone or something crazy under my name. \\n UPDATE 3  Car is now back in my possession, met the \"mother\" inside the open 99 cent store and finished the transaction. She actually showed me her drivers license and I said its totally fine I believe her. I gave her back the car amount + 50, and she was actually really nice. I do think whoever she is, she is just trying to protect her relative from whatever it is he is up too. Anyway, it was in a really poor part of town, and I realized that flipping cars can\\'t be making this guy a killing even if he gets really good deals on the cars and sells them for more than their worth. She told me she wanted me to have it back as it seems like I REALLY wanted it and that it must be important to me. She told me how much trouble her son puts her through, and all her medical problems and I did feel really empathetic toward her.  I admit I did feel kind of like a tool, I told myself I could have just let it all go, and not have had to go through the stress of hunting the guy down. But I mean its this belief that people are being honest  and are kind hearted that got me into trouble in the first place. Anyway, yeah I have the car back though and maybe the son will be more willing to trade the cars back he collects back to the owners before selling them illegally on craigslist. Originally 8 hours later i offered him +125.00 and he told me to F-off, but if he would have done it then none of this craziness would have happened and he would have been richer. \\n Oh also I got the paper I wrote on and like I said I didn\\'t sign anything, however he had signed it with this crazy unreadable signature, and placed on the paper a totally new phone number.',\n",
